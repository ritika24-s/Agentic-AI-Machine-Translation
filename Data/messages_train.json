If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, try and connect to a couple of different ports:\nUSB 2.0/3.0 A or USB-C, female type port directly on the computer.\n- Often times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\n- However, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in some cases a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options most importantly the USB 2.0/3.0 A port options.\n\n2. Depending on the BOSS device, connect using either:\n- A USB B type to USB 2.0 A cable: for old KATANA MKI/MKII\n**- A USB-C to USB-C cable: for new KATANA GEN3**\n**- A USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A cable: for new KATANA GEN3**\nFor example: **https://a.co/d/cmTWOuK**\n\nOR alternate USB cabling for other BOSS devices:\n**(****micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable****).**\nFor example used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, etc.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party or native security software running please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications. Some native security features on both WINDOWS/macOS can block proper connectivity, and app/driver functionality.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/0clHRgOHVre7Alk4Bbh0Rwrsp/?name=inline821420174.png)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**All instructions are included in the update download link, we'll try to reword them for you to see if it helps:**\n\nOnce you've extracted the zipped download, there should be a folder: **\"katana3_sys_v107\" folder**,\nyou'll need to copy/paste or drag/drop the two update files into the connected KATANA GEN3 amp update drive, when the amp is connected via USB in update mode.\nMake sure to first connect the amp in updater mode as instructed: [Hold down the TAP TEMPO button and power ON], then connect the KATANA via USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0A cable to your computer USB port.\nThe KATANA should connect and appear as an external drive, on your desktop: **KATANA3(DRIVE:).**\nYou'll then need to copy/paste or drag/drop the two update files: **KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT** files into/onto the drive.\nOnce copied over to the KATANA3(DRIVE:), you can soft-eject the drive by dragging it to the Trash (for macOS only) or right mouse click EJECT (works for WINDOWS/macOS).\nThen disconnect USB cable, this should start the update process, if it doesn't, then turn toward the amp and press the blinking RED LED PANEL button, manually if necessary. This will execute the update and will take about a minute to complete.\n\nOnce completed you should see all EFFECTS LEDS blinking GREEN simultaneously together showing a successful update.\nIf the EFFECT LEDs blink RED rapidly then the update was a failure and you'll need to try again.\n\nIn either situation, power OFF to exit updater mode and power back ON.\n\n* * *\n**PROCEDURE FOR THE UPDATE**\nCaution\n\n- You must not rename the extracted files.\n- Never turn off the KATANA GEN3's power while the update is in progress.\nOtherwise the system program or the KATANA GEN3 itself may be destroyed.\n\n**PROCEDURE FOR THE UPDATE**\n**Caution**\n\n- You must not rename the extracted file.\n- Never turn off the KATANA's power while the update is in progress. Otherwise the system program or the KATANA itself may be destroyed.\nPlease install the extracted system program files into your KATANA according to the following procedure.\n\n1. Adjust the [MASTER] knob to minimum.\n* Do not connect the KATANA and the computer yet.\n2. Turn the POWER switch on while holding down the [TAP] button.\nThe indicators for the [EFFECTS] buttons flash.\n3. Connect the computer to the KATANA's USB port by a USB cable.\n\"KATANA3\" drive appears on the computer screen.\n4. Open the KATANA3 icon.\n\"Removable Disk (*:)\" may appear instead of the KATANA3 icon.\n5. Copy (drag and drop) all the files included in the \"katana3_sys_v107.zip\" folder into the \"KATANA3\" icon.\n* Do not copy the \"katana3_sys_v107\" FOLDER.\nWith Windows\nRight-click on the \"KATANA3\" icon in My Computer (or the \"Removable Disk (*:)\" icon) and execute \"Eject.\"\nWith macOS\nDrag the \"KATANA3\" icon to the Trash icon in the Dock.\n6. Disconnect the USB cable, start the update process.\n7.

Exempel: (jag använder klockslag, så svårt att förklara annars...)\nKl. 12-13 gör jag ändringar i ljud, ändrar effekter, layers osv på några ljud jag ska ha på gig. Allt funkar. Alla write/saves funkar och är registrerade, man kan byta mellan ändrade och nya ljud och allt är finemang.\nKl 13 stänger jag av pianot, packar ner och åker till rep.\nKl 14 startar jag pianot. 9 gånger av 10 finns alla ändringarna som gjordes kl 12-13 kvar. Men ibland är allt som gjordes 12-13 borta, och ljud/parametrar är som de var före kl 12 - som att allt som gjordes kl 12-13 \"glömts bort\". Typ.

This is internal, completely without a computer connected and seems to mostly occur with layers or &quot;triple sounds&quot;.\n\n (It hasn't completely crashed since last time, but I've used Mainstage very little since then anyway...)\n\n Also, the write function doesn't work as it should, but only sometimes, and you don't really know when. Example: (I use time, so hard to explain otherwise...)\n At 12-1pm I make changes to the sound, change effects, layers, etc. on some sounds I'm going to have at the gig. Everything works. All writes/saves work and are registered, you can switch between changed and new sounds and everything is fine.\n At 1 p.m. I turn off the piano, pack up and go to the rehearsal room.\n At 2pm I start the piano. 9 times out of 10 all the changes made between 12pm and 1pm are still there. But sometimes everything that was made between 12pm and 1pm is gone, and the sound/parameters are as they were before 12pm - like everything that was made between 12pm and 1pm has been &quot;forgotten&quot;. Kind of.

En del stift inne i SD-dockan hade gått av.\n\n\n\nJag blev då refererad till en auktoriserad Roland verkstad. De ringde då er, som sa att den delen inte fanns att köpa löst utan i så fall skulle man behöva byta ut hela det pcb kortet.\n\n\n\nJag lyckades dock få tack på exakt den SD-dockan på nätet. Så verkstaden bytte ut den gamla dockan mot den nya (det tog en månad). Tyvärr funkade inte det utan när man tex försökte formatera kortet så stod det ”Format Error..” el liknande och försökte man göra en backup så stod det ”Error SD Card is Locked” trots att så inte var fallet.\n\n\n\nSå nu till min fråga, ( jag går lite omväga, efter att ha kikat på lödningarna som verkstaden gjort och de ser inte 100:a ut, men jag orkar inte med att argumentera med dom, då de är lite ”svåra” ), skulle ni kunna vara så snälla och kolla om just detta PCB kort (med SD-läsaren) finns i lager hos er i Europa och hur mycket ett sådant i så fall skulle kosta?\n\n\n\nModulen är inköpt 2017 och är väl inte inom garanti förmodar jag.\n\n\n\nMvh Kristian",

Some pins inside the SD dock had broken.\n\n\n\n I was then referred to an authorized Roland repair shop. They then called you, who said that the part was not available for purchase separately, but in that case you would have to replace the entire PCB board.\n\n\n\n However, I managed to get a quote for the exact SD card online. So the repair shop replaced the old card with the new one (it took a month). Unfortunately, it didn't work, but when you tried to format the card, it said &quot;Format Error..&quot; or something similar, and when you tried to make a backup, it said &quot;Error SD Card is Locked&quot; even though that wasn't the case.\n\n\n\n So now to my question, (I'm going a bit off topic, after looking at the soldering done by the workshop and they don't look 100%, but I can't bear to argue with them, as they are a bit &quot;difficult&quot;), could you be so kind as to check if this particular PCB board (with the SD reader) is in stock with you in Europe and if so, how much would one cost?\n\n\n\n The module was purchased in 2017 and is not under warranty, I assume.\n\n\n\n Regards, Kristian",

Could you please advise on the following:\n\n    The nearest authorized Roland service center that can carry out this repair.\n\n    Estimated turnaround time for this type of repair.\n\n    A rough idea of cost if possible (diagnostic and repair).\n\n    Whether this type of component can be replaced or if the top shell must be replaced as a unit.\n\nThanks in advance for your help.\n\nBest regards,\nRichie Garrison\nProduct Name: Aerophone Pro (AE-30)\nSerial Number: z7m4691\nPurchase Date: 2024-12-22\nPurchase Method: Secondhand\nPurchase Dealer: No Data",

Fame MS 57 dyn.) bleiben extrem leise, so gut wie gar nicht hörbar, trotz voll aufgedrehtem Regler, egal ob Phantomspeisung ein oder aus. Was tun?\n\nBei Aufnahmen zweier Spuren die Parallel laufen sollen (z.B Akkorde auf T1, Begleitung auf T2) kann ich bei Aufnahme der zweiten Spur nur den Drumrhythmus hören, nicht aber die Akkorde von T1.

What should I do?\n\n When recording two tracks that are supposed to run in parallel (e.g., chords on track 1, accompaniment on track 2), I can only hear the drum rhythm when recording the second track, but not the chords of track 1.

      "msg": "Hallo Christian,\n\nvielen Dank für Ihre Kontaktaufnahme!\n\nDer rote Peak-Indikator des RC-500 ist auf -6dBfs ausgelegt, was für Aufnahmezwecke relativ zur vollen Skala ist.\n\nDieser Wert wird berücksichtigt, damit das Audiomaterial nicht auf die volle Skala überläuft, wenn viele Overdubs übereinander gelegt werden.\nDa die grüne Peak-Anzeige bei der Nenneingabe aufleuchtet, können Sie sehen, dass es sich in diesem Zustand um einen angemessenen Aufnahmepegel handelt.\nIm Falle des RC-30 ist der Pegel, bei dem die Anzeige aufleuchtet, fast der Vollausschlag (0 dBfs),\nDie richtige Lautstärke wird also erreicht, wenn die Anzeige nicht leuchtet.\n\nWir haben ausgiebig mit verschiedenen Mikrofonen getestet, und Sie können ohne Probleme eine einheitliche Lautstärke erreichen. Wir verstehen jedoch, dass Sie vielleicht erwarten, dass der Mikrofoneingangspegel niedriger ist und/oder dass die Lichter die Farbe wechseln, aber wie oben erklärt, ist dies nicht unbedingt der Fall.\n\nEs handelt sich hierbei um ein anderes Design als beim Vorgängermodell (RC-30), aber es ist kein Fehler des Geräts und könnte erklären, warum Sie niedrigere Mikrofonpegel hören.\n\nWas die Aufnahme der beiden Spuren betrifft, die Sie mit dem RHYTHM haben, können Sie überprüfen, ob die Spur 2 einen ausreichenden Pegel hat, um in den Parametern des PLAY-Menüs gehört zu werden? Ich würde auch empfehlen, die INPUT- und OUTPUT-Einstellungen zu überprüfen, damit Ihr aufgenommener Input richtig gehört wird.\n\nWenn Sie die aufgezeichneten Audiodaten auf den PC übertragen, ist der RHYTHM standardmäßig nicht in dieser Übertragung enthalten. Um dies zu umgehen, müssen Sie entweder live in einer DAW aufnehmen (Ableton, Audacity, Reaper usw.).\n\nMit freundlichen Grüßen,\n\nHuw\n\nCustomer Service\n\nRoland Europe Group Ltd",

For example, to specify the rhythm part, set this to “PART R.” If this is “OFF,” velocity duck does not occur.\n\n**Duck Note: Any** C -–G 9.\nSpecifies the note of the Duck Part sound that is the target. For example, if you want to target the kick drum, specify “C2.” If you specify “Any,” all notes of that part are the target.\n\n**Duck Rate:** 0–100.\nSpecifies the proportion by which Velocity Duck lowers the velocity value. Higher values produce a greater ducking effect, so that with a setting of “100” there will be no sound at that timing (maximum velocity duck effect). With a setting of “0” there will be no velocity ducking.\n\nI hope you find this information useful.

They specialize in repairs for out-of-warranty and second-hand products and should be able to help you.\n\nTo find a convenient location, you can visit our European Engineers Map, which lists all our Service Partners.

I will register it with Roland once I receive it.\nWhile reading through the downloaded pdf owner's manual for the Fantom, I see it can take a 'pc card.' My question, is a pc card something like an SD card? If so, is there a maximum capacity that will work with the Fantom X7??\nSuch as 128MB, 256MB, etc?? \n\nWhen I search on Amazon for a 'pc card,' several different things are showing up, but only one thing looks like it might be what the manual refers to (flat, square). I would guess it may need formatting within the Fantom for it to work properly? \n\nIf someone at Roland can clarify this, I would appreciate it. I don't want to be inserting something into that slot on the keyboard that could damage it.\n\nThanks,\nTory W\nProduct Name: TD-17KV\nSerial Number: Z916668\nPurchase Date: 2025-03-12\nPurchase Method: Online\nPurchase Dealer: GUITAR CENTER #132",

      "msg": "Hello,\nActually, this is not for the TD-17, but for a Roland Fantom X7 I have ordered and is in transit to me. I will register it with Roland once I receive it.\nWhile reading through the downloaded pdf owner's manual for the Fantom, I see it can take a 'pc card.' My question, is a pc card something like an SD card? If so, is there a maximum capacity that will work with the Fantom X7??\nSuch as 128MB, 256MB, etc?? \n\nWhen I search on Amazon for a 'pc card,' several different things are showing up, but only one thing looks like it might be what the manual refers to (flat, square). I would guess it may need formatting within the Fantom for it to work properly? \n\nIf someone at Roland can clarify this, I would appreciate it. I don't want to be inserting something into that slot on the keyboard that could damage it.\n\nThanks,\nTory W\nProduct Name: TD-17KV\nSerial Number: Z916668\nPurchase Date: 2025-03-12\nPurchase Method: Online\nPurchase Dealer: GUITAR CENTER #132",

Dal nulla ha iniziato a non rispondere sempre al tocco della bacchetta, alle volte suona e molte altre no. Ho fatto delle prove con il jack del crash e funziona, quindi immagino che sia il filo/jack difettoso. Neanche a dirlo la batteria è ancora sostanzaliamente nuova e usata benissimo con tutte le accortezze del caso. Non ho mai tirato un filo e sono sempre stato attentissimo a trattarla bene. Volevo chiedere quindi in questi casi come funziona, immagino che si possa chiedere aiuto a voi per sistemare la faccenda, visto che la batteria è ancora in garanzia. Cosa posso fare?

Out of nowhere it started not to always respond to the touch of the stick, sometimes it plays and many other times it doesn't. I did some tests with the crash jack and it works, so I imagine that it is the faulty wire/jack. Needless to say, the battery is still substantially new and used very well with all the necessary precautions. I have never pulled a wire and I have always been very careful to treat it well. So I wanted to ask in these cases how it works, I imagine that we can ask you for help to fix the matter, since the battery is still under warranty. What can I do? I await your kind replies.\n PS If needed I can eat videos to show the situation.\n Product Name: TD-02KV\n Serial Number: A7Q1304\n Purchase Date: 2024-08-31\n Purchase Method: Online\n Purchase Dealer: MUSICALSTORE2005.COM SRL (Bari)",

Inline preamps are available in the market to address these specific low output issue from certain microphones:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkbTdHA42dw\n\nPlease let us know how it goes.\n\nKind regards,\nRoland Customer Support",

(I also have an Orca Worlde Pad connected to it to trigger drum sounds) I have a Lenovo laptop that runs my DAW.  I need serious support when it comes to routing the DAW tracks correctly. My main issue is that I get a constant infinite loop on my headphones when monitoring my audio track. I tried every single routing option in my DAW and on the RC600for over 4 days now. I wanted to input my vocals (via my mixing desk, and going out via SUB GROUP channel)  into INSTR1 input on the RC600. In my DAW I choose External Input 3 (INSTR1 L) but no matter the output choice. The signal is there but I end up with infinite feedback loop on almost all channels as soon as the monitor function is enabled. I want to add vocal effects and other things via the track in my DAW it seems also that the effect on my channel is not getting recorded. When choosing the \"individual\" function for my headphones on the RC600 all sounds are gone completely from my DAW. It seems that I can hear only recorded loops while everything else is muted that comes from my DAW to the looper.\nI wish to achieve a state where I can have a track for my mic only and a track for my guitar only in my DAW, As well as individual tracks for my midi instruments, which seems to work.

If your Fantom _was_ compatible, you'd be able to install Model Expansions using the Roland Cloud Connect app on your iOS or Android device.\n\nTo install Model Expansions via USB flash drive instead, you'd need to purchase a \"Lifetime Key\" for the product. After that, you can download it from the Hardware Instruments section on Roland Cloud, then transfer the files to your USB flash drive.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions — happy to help.\n\nBest regards,\nJules",

My shipping associate will email you prepaid UPS return label within the next 24 hours, and we'll get that one swapped out for the correct head.\n\nOnce you receive the return label, just drop the head off at any UPS location and show them the prepaid label on your phone or printed out and they'll take it from there.\n\nLet me know once it's dropped off so we can keep track of it. Per our warranty policy, as soon as we get that one back the correct one will ship.\n\nBe on the lookout from an email from my associate Frank for the return label and let me know if you have any questions along the way.\n\n\nBest,\n\nDan Diamond\n\n\n\n\n\nDW Drums Customer Support",

Can you confirm you are running the latest SH-01A System Program ( Ver.1.08 )?\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/d8axXHM0JE7kuMrmlC8BmdUCt/?name=image.png)\n\nSecondly...

If both of those aren't getting any change, Could you please send a Video of the issue occurring so I can see exactly what you are referring to in action? So I can try and replicate the issue on an SH01A on my end.\n\n\n\nKind Regards,\n**Braedon Good**\nTechnical Support/Customer Service\nRoland Australia\n🟥🟧🟨⬜\nw: www.roland.com/au w: www.boss.info/au",

Another option customers have used has been an online printing service that can print manuals and then deliver.\n\nHere's an example of an online printing service that will deliver right to your door:\nhttp://www.fedex.com/us/office/\n\nWe hope this helps!\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, try and connect to a couple of different ports:\nUSB 2.0/3.0 A or USB-C, female type port directly on the computer.\n- Often times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\n- However, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in some cases a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options most importantly the USB 2.0/3.0 A port options.\n\n2. Depending on the BOSS device, connect using either:\n- A USB B type to USB 2.0 A cable: for old KATANA MKI/MKII\n**- A USB-C to USB-C cable: for new KATANA GEN3**\n**- A USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A cable: for new KATANA GEN3**\nFor example: **https://a.co/d/cmTWOuK**\n\nOR alternate USB cabling for other BOSS devices:\n**(****micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable****).**\nFor example used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, etc.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party or native security software running please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications. Some native security features on both WINDOWS/macOS can block proper connectivity, and app/driver functionality.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/0clHRgOHVre7Alk4Bbh0Rwrsp/?name=inline821420174.png)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**All instructions are included in the update download link, we'll try to reword them for you to see if it helps:**\n\nOnce you've extracted the zipped download, there should be a folder: **\"katana3_sys_v107\" folder**,\nyou'll need to copy/paste or drag/drop the two update files into the connected KATANA GEN3 amp update drive, when the amp is connected via USB in update mode.\nMake sure to first connect the amp in updater mode as instructed: [Hold down the TAP TEMPO button and power ON], then connect the KATANA via USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0A cable to your computer USB port.\nThe KATANA should connect and appear as an external drive, on your desktop: **KATANA3(DRIVE:).**\nYou'll then need to copy/paste or drag/drop the two update files: **KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT** files into/onto the drive.\nOnce copied over to the KATANA3(DRIVE:), you can soft-eject the drive by dragging it to the Trash (for macOS only) or right mouse click EJECT (works for WINDOWS/macOS).\nThen disconnect USB cable, this should start the update process, if it doesn't, then turn toward the amp and press the blinking RED LED PANEL button, manually if necessary. This will execute the update and will take about a minute to complete.\n\nOnce completed you should see all EFFECTS LEDS blinking GREEN simultaneously together showing a successful update.\nIf the EFFECT LEDs blink RED rapidly then the update was a failure and you'll need to try again.\n\nIn either situation, power OFF to exit updater mode and power back ON.\n\n* * *\n**PROCEDURE FOR THE UPDATE**\nCaution\n\n- You must not rename the extracted files.\n- Never turn off the KATANA GEN3's power while the update is in progress.\nOtherwise the system program or the KATANA GEN3 itself may be destroyed.\n\n**PROCEDURE FOR THE UPDATE**\n**Caution**\n\n- You must not rename the extracted file.\n- Never turn off the KATANA's power while the update is in progress. Otherwise the system program or the KATANA itself may be destroyed.\nPlease install the extracted system program files into your KATANA according to the following procedure.\n\n1. Adjust the [MASTER] knob to minimum.\n* Do not connect the KATANA and the computer yet.\n2. Turn the POWER switch on while holding down the [TAP] button.\nThe indicators for the [EFFECTS] buttons flash.\n3. Connect the computer to the KATANA's USB port by a USB cable.\n\"KATANA3\" drive appears on the computer screen.\n4. Open the KATANA3 icon.\n\"Removable Disk (*:)\" may appear instead of the KATANA3 icon.\n5. Copy (drag and drop) all the files included in the \"katana3_sys_v107.zip\" folder into the \"KATANA3\" icon.\n* Do not copy the \"katana3_sys_v107\" FOLDER.\nWith Windows\nRight-click on the \"KATANA3\" icon in My Computer (or the \"Removable Disk (*:)\" icon) and execute \"Eject.\"\nWith macOS\nDrag the \"KATANA3\" icon to the Trash icon in the Dock.\n6. Disconnect the USB cable, start the update process.\n7. While the update is in progress, the \"EFFECTS\" indicators light up.\nWhen the update has finished, the \"EFFECTS\" indicators slowly flash simultaneously.\n8. Turn the KATANA3 power off.\n\nThis completes the update operation. The new system program runs at the next startup.\nFollow the procedure for verifying the version to verify that the version has been updated.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\nWe'll further explain the instructions provided in the Procedure for Update here:\n\n- **KATANA3 System Program (Ver.1.07)**\n- Set the KATANA-50/100/ARTIST GEN3 amp to \"updater mode\" by starting with amp OFF,\nPress and hold the [TAP] button, while powering ON the KATANA GEN3 amp.\n- Connect the USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A data cable from KATANA USB-C port to computer USB-C/ 2.0/3.0 A port.\nBlinking RED CHANNEL LEDs should be visible if not connected,\nSolid RED CHANNEL LEDs should be visible if already connected with the USB cable to computer.\n\nThe KATANA3(DRIVE:) should mount and appear on computer:\n- For WINDOWS KATANA3(DRIVE:) should appear in the WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER WINDOW left column.\n- For macOS the KATANA3 Drive Icon should appear on the desktop or in the FINDER.\n\nMake sure to download the update zip folder to your local drive and extract all the contents to your desktop, open the **katana3_sys_v107 folder, does not need to be extracted.**\nIf necessary RIGHT MOUSE CLICK the download and EXTRACT ALL to the DOWNLOADS folder or DESKTOP: ***katana3_sys_v107.zip (Compressed/zipped folder) needs to be EXTRACTED.**\nNOTE: macOS will automatically extract an unzip the download into the DOWNLOADS folder, open folder, use the two update files: **KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT** files.\nUser doesn't need to OPEN these files, only drag/drop or copy/paste these files into the mounted external KATANA3(DRIVE:).\n*For WINDOWS users, right-mouse click the zip then select Extract All, follow the instructions and extract to your desktop or know location.\nSee side by side of the ZIPPED(highlighted) vs. extracted unzipped folder:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/vezQ7t0wJZHhlMnmIy4a6KgiD/?name=image.png)\n**Already extracted, open folder: Select copy/paste or drag/drop the two files KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT files into the  KATANA3(DRIVE:) manually.**\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/KQeDHNUFeTwLEJKE1iOCpxgAR/?name=image.png)\nWhen doing the update, make sure to copy/paste, drag/drop only the two update files into the KATANA3(DRIVE:).\n**Again, use both the KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT files for the update.**\nNOT the zipped folder, or the extracted folder, ONLY these two update files should be added to the KATANA3(DRIVE:).\nOnce the update files are copied over into the KATANA3(DRIVE:) and only the two update files, soft-eject the KATANA3(DRIVE:), by Right Mouse Clicking, the KATANA3(DRIVE:) and choose EJECT.\nThen disconnect the USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A cable from the computer or amp.\n\nThis will trigger the amp to recognize the update and you'll see the KATANA GEN3 amp, start the update process automatically, if it doesn't, then press the PANEL button with the RED flashing LED.\nIf necessary, press the PANEL LED button once and this will execute the update firmware code you've added to the amp.\nWait about a minute for the update to complete, check for slow blinking **GREEN EFFECT LEDS for successful update.**\nOnce the update has been confirmed, power OFF, and power ON, complete.\n\nAfter attempting the update:\n- If the EFFECT LEDS are flashing GREEN slowly simultaneously together, this indicates the update was a success.\n- If the EFFECTS LEDS are flashing RED rapidly, this indicates the update failed and you'll need to try the process again.\nIn either circumstance/result, you'll need to recycle power, power OFF and back ON again to leave the \"updater mode.\"\n\nIt's ok to power OFF the amp after the update processes has run and completed.\nHowever, DON'T power OFF the amp while it's transmitting the update or in the process of updating.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**KATANA GEN3 FACTORY RESET INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/2PtLEtfq5Ch5kSdIwXovvCrHp/?name=inline1560582286.png)\n\n**ATTACHING THE BT-DUAL ADAPTER INSTRUCTIONS:**\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/hnk3slgafbjrm4MMWt18mcenb/?name=image.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards",

If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, it’s very important to try and connect to a dedicated USB 2.0 A female type port directly on the computer.\nOften times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\nHowever, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in which case a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options, most importantly the USB 2.0 A port option.\n\n2. Depending on the BOSS device, connect using either:\n(USB 2.0 A to B printer/data cable)\nFor example used with: KATANA MK1/MK2, KATANA-AIR, GT-1000, GT-100, GT-001, GT-1, GT-1B, SY-300, SY-1000, BOSS RV/DD/MD-500 Series Pedals, GR-55, RC-202, RC-3, RC-30, RC-300, RC-505 MK1, RC-505 MK2, RC-600, JS-10, GP-10, AD-10, VE-8, MS-3, ME-80, GP-10, etc.\n\nOR alternate USB cabling:\n(micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable).\nFor example, used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, etc.\n\n(USB C - to A Data Type Cable Option)\n(USB C - to C Data Type Cable Option 2)\nFor example, used with: Katana Gen 3, Katana:GO and IR-2.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary, when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party security software running, please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/HLAyr4WNBqRst4VWKFtUi4Ww0/?name=Screenshot+2024-07-10+at+4.37.54%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\n\n* * *\n\n**PLEASE FOLLOW STEPS BELOW TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL FIRMWARE UPDATES, DRIVERS and SOFTWARE EDITOR TO SYNC YOUR MS-3 AND COMPUTER:**\n\n**1.

It's been that way for over 30 years of us building drums. **_\n\n_**We do the overlap seams because wood is a living organic materiel. When drums travel through different climates, the shell can expand in heat and humidity. And shrink in cold temperatures. Over a period of time, we've learned that the seam on finish ply separate and develop an ugly gap. By doing the overlap, it prevents the finish ply from developing that issue.   **_\n\n_**And correct, your Satin Oil kit wouldn't have those type of seams because we don't need to do overlapping with wood. Those have whats called a buttseam. **_\n\n_**I hope this makes more sense to you and that you have a better understanding.**_\n_**If you have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me anytime via email or phone.

      "msg": "Hello Sean,\n\nThanks for reaching out and contacting Roland BOSS USA Operational Product Support about the GT-100.\nSorry you're still having issues with your GT-100 and BTS for GT connection using your macOS computer.\nUnfortunately, the GT-100 is over a decade old and now considered a discontinued legacy device.\nWe no longer provide support for these older vintage units that are over 10 years old.\n\nWith that said, we happened to have an old personal GT-100 kicking around on the shelf as well as a fairly new Mac Mini M1 Chipset desktop computer, with macOS 15.5 update installed.\nSo, using the online GT-100 Downloads page, resources and web links,\nwe updated the GT-100 to the latest firmware version, installed the GT-100 USB device driver, and installed the BTS for GT software editor.\nWe connected up via our old USB 2.0 A to B printer/data cable, and connected to a USB-C Hub with a compatible USB 2.0 A port, and all connected and synced perfectly fine, without issue. The initial connection and load up is a little slow, but once connected all works great, we backed up all the default patches to the Librarian, and downloaded all the Tone Central artist collection patches to the Librarian and loaded some Architects patches, to check.\nAll worked great, so not sure what the issue is you're having, but you may want to use the GT-100 Downloads, and start fresh/new.\nThen make sure to troubleshoot your USB 2.0 A to B data cable connection and make sure to check and try some alternate USB 2.0 A to B data cables, and try some alternate USB 2.0 A ports on the computer or use a 3rd party USB-C Hub with compatible USB 2.0 A port (black inside). Some USB 3.0 A ports (blue inside) are not backwards compatible and will not provide the proper connectivity, unless directly on the macOS computer.\n\n**Here's the downloads we used, to get updated and properly connected on our macOS 15.5 computer:**\n**GT-100 System Program ( Ver.2.12 )**\n**GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.5 for macOS Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for GT-100 Ver.1.1.3 for macOS / OS X**\n\n* * *\n**USB CONNECTIVITY TROUBLESHOOTING:**\n\n1. If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, it’s very important to try and connect to a dedicated USB 2.0 A female type port directly on the computer.\nOften times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\nHowever, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in which case a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter and it provides multiple USB connectivity options most importantly the USB 2.0 A port option.\n\n2. Depending on the BOSS device, connect using either:\n(USB 2.0 A to B printer/data cable)\nFor example used with: KATANA MK1/MK2, KATANA-AIR, GT-1000, GT-100, GT-001, GT-1, GT-1B, SY-300, SY-1000, BOSS RV/DD/MD-500 Series Pedals, GR-55, RC-202, RC-3, RC-30, RC-300, RC-505 MK1, RC-505 MK2, RC-600, JS-10, GP-10, AD-10, VE-8, MS-3, ME-80, GP-10, etc.\n\nOR alternate USB cabling:\n(micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable).\nFor example used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, etc.\n\n(USB C - to A Data Type Cable Option)\n(USB C - to C Data Type Cable Option 2)\nFor example used with: Katana Gen 3, Katana:GO and IR-2.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party security software running please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/HLAyr4WNBqRst4VWKFtUi4Ww0/?name=Screenshot+2024-07-10+at+4.37.54%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE SEE OUR GT-100 SUPPORT INFO AND WEB LINKS BELOW:**\n\n**GT-100 FEATURES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gt-100/**\n\n**GT-100 SPECIFICATIONS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gt-100/specifications/**\n\n**GT-100 ACCESSORIES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gt-100/accessories/**\n\n* * *\n**GT-100 UPDATES, DRIVERS and DOWNLOADS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gt-100/downloads/**\n\n**GT-100 SYSTEM PROGRAM VERSION 2.10 UPDATE (LATEST DEVICE FIRMWARE):**\n\n- **GT-100 System Program ( Ver.2.12 )**\n\n* * *\n**GT-100 USB DEVICE DRIVER (INSTALL THE CORRECT DRIVER FOR COMPUTER OS & VERSION - WINDOWS/MAC):**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gt-100/downloads/**\n\n**=>WINDOWS DRIVERS:**\n\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.1 for Windows 10/11**\n-\n\n**GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.0.0 for Windows 10**\n\n**This contains information on the GT-100 Ver.2 driver compatible with Microsoft Windows 10.**\n\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.0 for Windows 8.1 / 8 / 7**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.0.0 for Windows 8.1 / 8 / 7 / Vista / XP**\n\n_**=>macOS DRIVERS:**_\n\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.5 for macOS Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.4 for macOS Big Sur 11.x / Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.3 for macOS 10.15**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.2 for macOS 10.13 / 10.14**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.1.1 for macOS / OS X**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.0.0 for OS X 10.11**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.0.0 for OS X 10.10**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Driver Ver.2.0.0 for Mac OS X**\n\n* * *\n**ADOBE AIR UPDATE (DOWNLOAD and INSTALL BEFORE INSTALLING BOSS TONE STUDIO):**\n\n**The Adobe Air update can be downloaded securely here via Harman:**\n**Usually Adobe Air is not needed, however for some older computers, user will need to install Adobe Air before installing BTS for GT-100 software editor.**\n**https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime**\n**(ATTACHED)**\n\n* * *\n**BOSS TONE STUDIOS FOR GT-100 (INSTALL ADOBE AIR UPDATE BEFORE INSTALLING BOSS TONE STUDIOS):**\n\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GT Ver.1.1.3 for Windows**\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GT-100 Ver.1.1.3 for macOS / OS X**\n_**NOTE: BOSS TONE STUDIOS HAS AN INTEGRATED LIBRARIAN. **_\n_**25 CLASSIC TONES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH BOSS TONE STUDIOS, USE OLDER LIBRARIAN.**_\n\n* * *\n**LIBRARIAN SOFTWARE FOR GT-100 (SEE NOTE ABOVE BEFORE INSTALLING)**\n\n- **GT-100 Librarian for Windows v1.01**\n- **GT-100 Librarian for Macintosh**\n\n**GT-100 25 CLASSIC TONES FOR DOWNLOAD (NOTE: LIBRARIAN IS NECESSARY TO INSTALL 25 CLASSIC TONES):**\n**GT-100 25 Classic Tones**\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**GT-100 SUPPORT INFORMATION:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gt-100/support/**\n\n**GT-100 OWNER'S MANUAL (PDF):**\n**GT-100 Owner's Manual**\n\n**GT-100 PARAMETER GUIDE (PDF):**\n- **GT-100 Parameter Guide**\n- **Parameter List**\n- **Addendum**\n- **Patch List**\n\n* * *\n**GT-100 VERSION 2.0 ADDENDUM (PDF):**\n- **About GT-100 Ver. 2**\n**GT-100 VERSION 2.0 PRESET PATCH LIST (PDF):**\n- **GT-100 Ver.2 Preset Patch List**\n\n* * *\n**USING BOSS TONE STUDIOS FOR GT-100 MANUAL (PDF):**\n**Using BOSS TONE STUDIO for GT**\n\n* * *\n**GT-100 MIDI IMPLEMENTATION:**\n**MIDI Implementation**\n**GT-001 / GT-100 Ver.2 MIDI Implementatio**n\n\n* * *\n**GT-100 TURBO START:**\n**GT-100 Turbo Start**\n\n**GT-100 KNOWLEDGE BASE ARTICLES (SEARCH \"GT-100\"):**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/support/knowledge_base/**\n\n\n\nKind regards",

Unfortunately, I've done basically all the steps described above re: troubleshooting (changing USB cables, changing ports, updating software/drivers/firmware, etc.) and it just doesn't work. What's odd is that Tone Studio _sees my GT-100 device when it is connected_, but it simply can't get a successful connection when I select it. It always fails with the same error message every time. And again, my DAW (Logic) sees it fine as well and I can record perfectly fine with it. It's just the Tone Studio application that seems to bork out. Anyway, I understand that this is a legacy device and so of course support will only last for some time (I myself am actually a software developer), so it may just be that my computer for whatever reason will not allow me to work with Tone Studio anymore with this device. It's not a deal breaker since this has been an issue for about 3 1/2 years now, but I was hoping I _might_ be able to get things working after updating MacOS, Logic, and everything else.

The MIDI bulk dump option is in the SYSTEM button menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards",

This will unzip and make the update files usable by the SMF player.\n=> For macOS users, the firmware update download will auto extract/unzip, and is ready to use in your Downloads folder.\n\n- Download the SMF MIDI update file player and use it to update your SY-200 (WINDOWS/macOS)\n- => SMF Player for Windows\n\n- **=>macOS SMF APP:**\nSMF Player for macOS Big Sur 11.x - macOS Sequoia 15.x\nFor macOS Big Sur 11.x and later, please use this.\n\n- If on macOS please make sure to use the correct SMF player for your macOS version.\nIf using the incorrect player, it will scramble the order of the MIDI files for the firmware update.\n\n- Download and extract/open the firmware update:\nThis is a screen capture from WINDOWS, see how there's a zipper across the folder, this shows it's zipped and compressed.\n- So you need to RIGHT MOUSE CLICK it and choose EXTRACT ALL, and extract the contents to the desktop. See highlighted below and description is Compressed(Zipped), extract the contents.\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/xLhMvTUlSE33kbqiJ6GU0OtUI/?name=image.png)\n\n**ONCE EXTRACTED, SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS:**\n- **See highligthed below, it is unzipped and with files inside ready to use.**\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/vVsVHycIBdBmhaNRzlxegIn91/?name=image.png)\n\n\n- Keep the extracted/unzipped, folder : SY200_sys_v103 available or easily to locate, on your desktop, or in the Downloads folder.\n- Double click and open the UPDSMFJ MIDI player application, see App Icon below:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/1ZBLOjdTkZFYIui3lvwruxrVv/?name=image.png)\n\n\n1.

We test and use the following USB hub adapter, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options most importantly the USB 2.0 A port option.\n\nExample Cable:\n(micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable).\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\nIf you have any onboard computer 3rd party security software running, please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

I’ll do my best to answer your questions clearly:\n\n\n-\n\nThe Fantom 8 EX comes with a **2-year manufacturer’s warranty**. You can find full details on warranty coverage and how to request service at the link below:\n\nWarranty Info & Service Requests\n\n- If you purchased a **Fantom EX** (indicated on the packaging and top panel), the upgrade is **already pre-installed**—no need to purchase it separately.\n- While we can’t comment on future product releases or timelines, there are **no new Fantom workstations** expected in the next several months to a year that I know of. The EX series is the latest release.\n-\n\nRegarding sampling from your Integra synthesizer: yes, you can import those samples into the **sampler section** of the Fantom EX and assign them chromatically across the keybed (as multisamples). This is demonstrated in the following video, around the **4:30** and **8:20** marks:\n\nFantom EX Sampling Demo\n\n-\n\nThe current system version for the Fantom EX is **1.02**, available here:\n\nFantom EX Downloads\n\n\n\nAlso, we love hearing stories from customers about their vintage Roland gear—thanks for sharing! Sorry to hear yours couldn’t be repaired, but we’re glad it brought you joy while it lasted.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions or if you’d like help with purchasing or locating a dealer!",

Carry out this update.\nWhen the **MANUAL** and **MEMORY 3** indicators light up, the version is 1.02. Carry out this update.\nWhen the **MANUAL** and **MEMORY 2** indicators light up, the version is 1.03. Carry out this update.\nIf the **MANUAL** and **MEMORY 1** indicators light up, the version is the latest version (version 1.04), there's no need to update your DM-101.\n\n2.\n\nAfter verifying the version, switch off the power.\n\n\n\nIn order to perform the update for the DM-101, you'll need the following pieces of gear.\n1x micro USB A-B 2.0 data transfer rated\n1x DM-101 DELAY MACHINE\n1x BOSS PSA-120(s) power adaptor\n1x your computer MAC or WINDOWS\n1x SMF Player current version\nOnce you have these components, you're ready to perform the update to version 1.03.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### **Step 1: **\nDownload the update files needed from the website link below.\nRE-202 FIRMWARE SYSTEM PROGRAM UPDATE:\n**DM-101 SYSTEM PROGRAM ( VER.1.04 )**\nscroll to the bottom of the webpage, click the agree check box, and then click DOWNLOAD on the website. Your computer should start downloading the zip folder named \"dm101_sys_v104\".\nAfter this zip folder is downloaded, you'll need to open this folder.\nOn MAC, simply double-click the zip folder and MAC will unzip the folder automatically into a copy called \"dm101_sys_v104\"\nOn Windows, It is best to EXTRACT ALL to your DESKTOP, this makes accessing the files easier for the next steps in the update.\n\n\n* * *\n\n### **Step 2: **\nPut your DM-101 into Update Mode and connect the DM-101 to a USB 2.0 compatible port on your computer.\nHold down the [**MEMORY**] foot switch and connect the included AC adaptor to turn on the power.\nThe DM-101 powers up, and only the indicator of the [**ON/OFF**] switch lights up.\nConnect the DM-101 and the computer using the USB cable.\nDownload and open the SMF player that matches your computer's operating system below.\n\n**SMF Player for macOS Big Sur 11.x - macOS Sequoia 15.x**\n**SMF PLAYER FOR MACOS 10.13 - MACOS 14.X**\n**SMF PLAYER FOR WINDOWS**\n**SMF PLAYER FOR MACOS / OS X**\n\nOpen the SMF Player and you should see the DM-101 as a selectable option.\nIf you do not see DM-101 as a selectable option, please try a different USB cable to connect the DM-101 that is rated for Data Transfer 2.0.\n**USB CONNECTIVITY TROUBLESHOOTING:**\n1. If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, it’s very important to try and connect to a dedicated USB 2.0 A female type port directly on the computer.\nOften times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\nHowever, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in which case a USB hub adaptor may be necessary. We test and use the following **USB hub adaptor**, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options, most importantly the USB 2.0 A port option.\nUSB cabling:\n**(****micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable****).**\nFor example used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, DM-101, RE-202 etc.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary, when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party security software running, please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/IubCIzk0lsWmBALEPnFHQ43nh/?name=inline-1581383714.png)\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n### **Step 3: **\nIn the SMF Player, select DM-101 as the MIDI OUT device\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/GWe98aJpewDZOynDBCrklQaFc/?name=Screen+Shot+2023-12-11+at+4.53.13+PM.png)\n\nClick [**Path**] (click [**Select...**] for Mac) on “UpdSMF” and specify the location where the update files from SMF Path (SMF Folder for Mac). Then, click the [**OK**] button. Make sure to select the folder labeled \"dm101_sys_v104\". Please do not attempt to select the .mid or TXT files inside the folder, the DM-101 need all files in the folder labeled \"dm101_sys_v104\" for the update process.\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/7LkVwZ2xjOPlHwExvvx3nn4s9/?name=Screen+Shot+2023-12-11+at+4.53.41+PM.png) ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/4f5mnE6x5sAHMRSRWJrl7eQih/?name=Screen+Shot+2023-12-11+at+4.53.52+PM.png)\n\n\nOnce the folder \"dm101_sys_v104\" have been selected, and you see the .mid files present in the SMF Player, press SEND\n\nWhen the DM-101 [**ON/OFF**] and [**TAP**] switch indicators light, the update has finished.\nThe SMF Player will also display COMPLETE.\nDisconnect the USB cable and disconnect the AC adaptor to turn off the power.\nYou've successfully completed the update for the DM-101 DELAY MACHINE Pedal.\nUse the How to tell the Version instructions from earlier to confirm the update was successful.\n\nBelow are additions to the DM-101 with the firmware v1.04.\n\n**UPDATE HISTORY**\n   [**Ver.1.04**] APR 2024\n\nBug Fixes\nThe following bugs have been fixed.\n\n-\n\nFixed an issue where the DELAY TIME change sound was heard when switching MEMORY during MIDI SYNC operation.\n\n\n[**Ver.1.03**] DEC 2023\n\nBug Fixes\nThe following bugs have been fixed.\n\n- Fixed an issue in which the DELAY TIME was short only when VARIATION 4, 5, 9 was used in MULTI-HEAD mode during MIDI sync operation.\n\n\n[**Ver.1.02**] OCT 2023\n\nBug Fixes\nThe following bugs have been fixed.\n\n- The issue with the delay sound sometimes not produced when changing the delay mode while MIDI sync is in use has been fixed.\n- The position of the [**DELAY VOLUME**] knob at which sound starts to be produced has been improved.\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

So usually, the first effect will have the most wet sound.\nIf using the RV-6 in the IR-2 FX LOOP: SEND/RETURN, it comes after the amp and cab but before the ambiance effect block, so is further down, but not last in the effect chain.\n\nAre you connecting the RV-6 to the FX LOOP: with a Mono or Stereo Return option?\nYou could try using the IR-2 FX LOOP: Stereo Return option, this may also make the effect more pronounced if using headphones which are also stereo monitoring.\n\nReview page 18 of the manual for how to change the RETURN setting to STEREO:\nYou'll also need a sold separate, INSERT Y CABLE with 1/4\" TRS Stereo end and two 1/4\" TS mono ends.\nThis allows to SEND MONO from the IR-2, and use the STEREO RETURN on the IR-2 and connect to the LEFT and RIGHT MONO OUTPUTS of the RV-6.\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/bez2JqfzEYYMpUwHnpFzpSZr3/?name=image.png)\n\n* * *\nHere are some tips when using an IR-2:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/oZ4LrZ4vIwKtGqB1uK6oVLYQq/?name=image.png)\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE REVIEW OUR IR-2 SUPPORT INFO AND WEB LINKS BELOW**\n\n**IR-2 FEATURES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/ir-2/features/**\n\n**IR-2 SPECS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/ir-2/specifications/**\n\n**IR-2 ARTICLES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/ir-2/articles/**\n\n**IR-2 ACCESSORIES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/ir-2/accessories/**\n\n**IR-2 DOWNLOADS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/ir-2/downloads/**\n\n**IR-2 FIRMWARE UPDATE: N/A**\n\n\n#### **IR-2 UPDATES & DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS/mACOS**\n**=>WINDOWS:**\n\n- **IR-2 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for Windows 10/11**\n**=>macOS:**\n\n- **IR-2 Driver Ver.1.0.1 for macOS Sonoma 14.x**\n- **IR-2 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Big Sur 11.x / Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x**\n\n**IR-2 IR LOADER FOR WINDOWS/macOS:**\n\n- **IR-2 IR Loader Ver.1.00 for Windows**\n- **IR-2 IR Loader Ver.1.00 for macOS**\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**IR-2 SUPPORT & DOCUMENTATION**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/ir-2/support/**\n\n\n**IR-2 OWNER'S MANUAL:**\n\n- [English] IR-2 Owner's Manual [HTML]\n- [English] IR-2 Owner's Manual [PDF]\n\n**IR-2 IR LOADER MANUAL**\n\n- [English] IR-2 IR Loader Owner's Manual [HTML]\n- [English] IR-2 IR Loader Owner's Manual [PDF]\n\n\nKind regards\n\nKind regards",

I’m wondering, is this is a piece of equipment you service? We’d love to determine if we’re better off to repair the unit or replace it- or if it makes more sense to just fully modernize the exhibit with some new video technology. I can be reached here at conroy@bostonchildrensmuseum.org and my desk line is 6179863674. Thanks!",

There is no postal service available at our service location, SO PLEASE DO NOT SHIP VIA USPS. Please make sure signature is required for package delivery.\n\nPersonnel at this address are not authorized to receive repairs directly from customers. Any attempt to drop off units will be rejected.\n\nPlease write your RA# clearly on the outside of the shipping box underneath the address. If this is a warranty repair, please place a copy of your sales receipt inside the box. We recommend that you insure your V-4EX with your shipping carrier to cover any accidental damage or loss that may occur in the shipping process.\n\nFor non-warranty repairs, we will contact you with an estimate after we have inspected your V-4EX. In most cases this will be 3-5 business days after we receive it.\n\nKind Regards,\nRoland Service Department",

      "msg": "Christine,\n\nThanks for reaching out and contacting Roland BOSS USA Operational Product Support about the KATANA-100 GEN 3.\n\nEvery guitar amp will have varying noise floor, which is the noise/sound when idle.\nThis may differ depending on the AMP TYPE chosen and GAIN/VOLUME settings for the KATANA GEN3 amp.\nIf necessary, you can use the BTS for KATANA GEN3 software editor, each Channel is provided an NS/Noise Suppressor, to help gate the noise, whenever not playing.\nSo this is really useful when using high gain amp types and higher gain/volume settings, use the NS set with a higher threshold to gate out the sound, use the decay/release adjustment to make the gate sound more natural upon release, rather than abrupt.\nPANEL mode is like any normal guitar amp, what you see knob wise, is what you hear.\n\nWhile all the other CHANNELS are write/saved preset patches with saved settings.\nWhen switching CHANNELS the knobs will not necessarily indicate what is set, the knobs are not motorized, and can't shift into place for every CHANNEL.\nSo if you touch a knob, it will catch up to that current position, but the actual saved preset value, may be higher or lower than what the knob is actually indicating.\nThis may take some time getting used to, but pretty much you can set your sound, with any of the knobs or software editor, then press hold a CHANNEL to save your settings, if using the editor use the WRITE button to write/save your custom user settings.\n\nYou can use the MASTER LEVEL volume to control the over all output of the amp, however, the POWER CONTROL and MASTER LEVEL can't be write/saved to a CHANNEL, these always remain separate, and for on the fly manual adjustment by hand, the values of POWER CONTROL and MASTER LEVEL, can not be saved to the CHANNEL.\nAll the other parameters can be write/saved to the CHANNEL or patch: AMP TYPE, GAIN, VOLUME, EQ, EFFECTS, PRESENCE, etc., can all be saved to the CHANNEL/PATCH.\n\nWe suggest, using more of your POWER AMP, so use the 50W POWER CONTROL setting, and use the MASTER LEVEL a bit more.\nThen choose your CHANNEL, adjust the AMP TYPE, GAIN and VOLUME, adjust EQ and FX ON/OFF, then save the settings, by holding down the CHANNEL button.\nA quick way of balancing CHANNELS, it to take this same \"template patch\" and save the same settings to all the other CHANNELS.\nOnce all are the same, then start making derivative changes to each CHANNEL, and save accordingly.\nThis may provide more of balanced CHANNELS/patches when switching.\nHowever, keep in mind changing the AMP TYPE, is like changing the modeled amp type, so it may need a GAIN or VOLUME increase/decrease.\n\nHope this all makes sense.\n\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE REVIEW OUR KATANA-100 GEN3 SUPPORT INFO & WEB LINKS BELOW:**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 FEATURES: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 SPECS: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/specifications/**\n\n** KATANA-100 GEN3 GUIDES/ARTICLES: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/articles/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 ACCESSORIES: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/accessories/**\n\n* * *\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 DOWNLOADS: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/downloads/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 MOBILE DEVICE APPS FOR ANDROID/IOS:**\n**(NOTE: BT-DUAL ADAPTER NEEDED & SOLD SEPARATELY) **\n**BTS for KATANA Gen 3 Android**\n**BTS for KATANA Gen 3 Apple iOS**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 FIRMWARE UPDATE: **\n\n- **KATANA3 System Program (Ver.1.07)**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 USB DEVICE DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS/macOS:**\n**=>WINDOWS:**\n\n- **KATANA3 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for Windows 10/11**\n**=>macOS:**\n\n- **KATANA3 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n** **\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 BTS SOFTWARE EDITOR FOR WINDOWS/macOS COMPUTER:**\n\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for KATANA Gen3 Ver.1.1.0 for Windows**\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for KATANA Gen3 Ver.1.1.0 for macOS**\n\n* * *\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/support/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 STARTUP GUIDE:**\n**KATANA3 STARTUP GUIDE [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 REFERENCE MANUAL:**\n**KATANA3 REFERENCE MANUAL [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 USING BTS FOR KATANA GEN3 SOFTWARE EDITOR GUIDE:**\n**USING BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 (FOR PC) [PDF]**\n**USING BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 (FOR MOBILE) [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 CONNECTING BTS FOR KATANA GEN3 iOS/ANDROID APP TO KATANA GUIDE:**\n**CONNECTING THE BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 IOS APP TO THE KATANA UNIT [PDF]**\n**CONNECTING THE BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 ANDROID APP TO THE KATANA UNIT [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA GEN3 FACTORY RESET INSTRUCTIONS:**\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/5JsnKxTaVhrY7aX0SWy0LVkM7/?name=image.png)\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

      "msg": "Hello Robert,\n\nThanks for reaching out and contacting Roland BOSS USA Operational Product Support about the RC-600 / Tascam DP-03SD.\nUnfortunately, we don't provide 3rd party device support or instructions for exporting/importing audio from a hardware to your RC-600.\nWe are unable to provide individual audio flow effect chain, or computer tech assistance and consultation.\n**With that said, the general process or overview would be a workflow similar to below:**\n\nWe reviewed your TASCAM recorder specs and audio file specs and found the following here:\nThe **DP-03SD Digital Portastudio 8-Track Recorder** from **TASCAM** is a multitrack digital recorder capable of recording 2 channels simultaneously for up to 8 channels total. The DP-03SD records 16-bit/44.1 kHz resolution audio to SD/SDHC cards and can export your mix to your computer via USB.\n\nSo from the TASCAM, connect to computer or use SD/SDHC card with audio files, upload these to your computer.\nThese will most likely be 16bit 44.1kHz WAV audio files.\nThese TASCAM WAV audio files are a lower spec and quality that what the **RC-600 reads/writes: 32/24bit 44.1kHz .WAV audio files.**\n\nSo once you've extracted the TASCAM WAV audio files to your computer, you'll need to use a WAV audio file converter, or DAW audio software application, or a simpler audio converter, available online, simply Google Search: \"audio file converter\"\n\nYou'll need to up-sample your TASCAM WAV audio, to meet the specs of the RC-600.\nSo use the audio converter, or a DAW audio software: Garageband, Logic Pro, ProTools, Ableton, Audacity, Reaper, etc. to up-sample your TASCAM audio to the RC-600 audio specs, so that the audio files are compatible for playback by the RC-600.\n**RC-600 reads/writes: 32/24bit 44.1kHz WAV audio files.**\n\nOnce you've updated converted the TASCAM audio and up-sampled the audio files to the correct RC-600 specs, then you can import these into your RC-600 using the following RC software tool, connect with USB Storage Mode: ON, and the RC-600(DRIVE:) will appear as an external drive on your computer, and you can open the ROLAND folder > then open the WAV folder, and you can load any compatible WAV audio files to each MEMORY location and any of the 6 Tracks of each MEMORY location/patch.\nYou may also use the BTS for RC tool for importing/exporting audio to your RC-600, please make sure the audio is converted first for proper playback and usage, otherwise, the RC-600 may read, \"unsupported format\".\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for RC Ver.1.3.0 for Windows**\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for RC Ver.1.3.0 for macOS**\n\n**Please also make sure your RC-600 firmware is up up-to-dateth the latest version:**\n**RC-600 System Program ( Ver.1.50 )**\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE REVIEW OUR RC-600 SUPPORT INFO AND WEBLINKS BELOW**\n\n**RC-600 FEATURES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-600/features/**\n\n**RC-600 SPECS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-600/specifications/**\n\n**RC-600 ARTICLES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-600/articles/**\n\n**RC-600 ACCESSORIES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-600/accessories/**\n\n* * *\n**RC-600 UPDATES, DOWNLOADS AND DRIVERS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/rc-600/downloads/**\n\n**RC-600 SYSTEM PROGRAM FIRMWARE UPDATE:**\n**RC-600 System Program ( Ver.1.50 )**\n\n**RC-600 USB DRIVERS (WINDOWS/macOS):**\n**WINDOWS:**\n**RC-600 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for Windows 10/11**\n\n**macOS:**\n**RC-600 Driver Ver.1.0.1 for macOS Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n**RC-600 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Big Sur 11.x / Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x**\n**RC-600 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS 10.15**\n\n**BOSS TONE STUDIOS for RC application tool:**\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for RC Ver.1.3.0 for Windows**\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for RC Ver.1.3.0 for macOS**\n** **\n**RC RHYTHM CONVERTER:**\n**RC Rhythm Converter Ver.1.0.0 for Windows**\n**RC Rhythm Converter Ver.1.0.1 for macOS**\n\n* * *\n**RC-600 SUPPORT DOCS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/rc-600/support/**\n\n**RC-600 OWNER'S MANUAL:**\n**[English] RC-600 Owner's Manual [PDF]**\n\n**RC-600 PARAMETER GUIDE:**\n**[English] RC-600 Parameter Guide [PDF]**\n**[9 languages] Changes to the auto-off function specifications [PDF]**\n\n\n#### **RC-600 KNOWLEDGE BASE ARTICLES:**\n\n- **RC-600: Differences between the RC-600 and RC-300**\n- **RC-600: How to duplicate Memory settings to another Memory location?**\n- **RC-600: Stereo Field Input and Output Routing Explained**\n- **RC-600: How to record the internal Rhythm part onto a Track**\n- **RC-600, RC-500, RC-5, RC-300: If not able to Import an Audio File \"Unsupported Format\" Message**\n- **RC-600: Can I erase the data I first recorded after doing several overdubs?**\n- **RC-600: Can I synchronize the track record/playback or stop with the rhythm playback/stop?**\n- **RC-600: How many seconds long (or greater) does a phrase have to be in order to save?**\n- **RC-600: What is the maximum number of memories that can be saved?**\n- **RC-600: Is there any limit on how many times I can overdub?**\n- **RC-600: Can I specify the range to be looped for playback?**\n- **RC-600: Mixing and recording playback sound from multiple tracks**\n- **RC-600: What format is used for recording?**\n\n* * *\n**RC-600 FACTORY RESET**\n\nKind regards",

Sometimes customers jump into things that are perhaps a little too advanced before having a grasp of the instrument.\n\nWe always appreciate the time you and the Sweetwater staff take to troubleshoot. Perhaps this is a case where the customer should direct his questions to us directly as there are obvious errors in the wording they're using that is making it hard to understand the issue. We don't expect you guys to know the really advanced features of every piece of gear, there's too much to know, and you guys know and do so much already.\n\nPlease direct the customer to:\n\nhttps://www.roland.com/backstage/login\n\nIt should only take them two minutes to set up an account and they'll be able to submit a ticket quite easily. They can even bypass the instrument registration procedure and go directly to \"PRE-SALES ADVICE\" to submit their question since they've already been waiting for a bit.\n\nAsk them to mention that they've been transferred by Sweetwater and that their FANTOM-8 EX issue is ongoing.\n\nI will see the ticket and handle asap. Once I \"hopefully\" resolve the issue, I can send you guys a summary in case the customer returns to you for more info.\n\nThanks!\n\nRoland Customer Support\nThis email was written by an actual human being.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, simply reply to this message.\n\n*Please note that we aim to respond within 48 hours.

Some 3rd party other brand power supplies, can cause temporary device issues, or terminal damage.\nUsing a 3rd party other brand power supply will void all warranty terms.\n\n- Test and check all cabling, use 1/4\" TS mono unbalanced, instrument/guitar cables, for all guitar audio Input/Output connections, for proper connectivity, and audio signal transfer.\n\n- Connect a 1/4\" TS Mono Instrument guitar cable to pedal INPUT for pedal power ON/OFF.\n_(For BOSS RC COMPACT LOOPERS: Connect to **OUTPUT A** for power ON)._\n\n- For example cabling, use quality BOSS BIC Lifetime Instrument Cables for all guitar effect chain audio signal cable connections. _(NOTE: DO NOT USE_ _1/4\" TRS STEREO CABLES_ _FOR GUITAR EFFECT CHAIN AUDIO CONNECTIONS. TRS cables may not engage the INPUT jack for power ON properly. TRS cables can be used for HEADPHONES audio connections, to a dedicated HEADPHONE jack, or for FS/EXP (FOOTSWITCH/EXPRESSION) CV/CONTROL VOLTAGE external control pedals)._\n\n**EXPLANATION AND VISUAL OF DIFFERENT AUDIO CABLES:**\nTS = TIP SLEEVE (UNBALANCED),\nTRS = TIP RING SLEEVE (STEREO/BALANCED),\nTRRS = TIP RING RING SLEEVE (STEREO LINE LEVEL WITH MIC/MOBILE DEVICE).\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/uDQRgtwMWKdTbpBwFYntcI8OF/?name=inline1957521896.jpeg)\n\n- Review the BOSS pedal included Owner's Manual for functionality and how to use the pedal or go online for the Owner's Manual PDF downloadable:  https://www.boss.info/us/support/owners_manuals/\nSearch alphabetically for your device model and owner's manual.\n\n- If the pedal is still malfunctioning, then we suggest exchanging with your point of purchase/dealer/store/web store, for a new product, under the dealer's warranty (usually 30-day warranty terms).\n\nPlease inform the dealer/sales tech, of the product issues you're having, and arrange an exchange of product, for a new device. This would help with an expedited quick turn around.\n\n- If outside of Dealer Warranty terms and Manufacturer Warranty Service/Repair is needed, you may choose to submit a Service Repair Request to our Roland BOSS Factory Service Department in Chino, CA. Once you have an RA/Return Authorization number, you may send your device in, for evaluation, diagnosis, service and repair.\n\n- All BOSS stompbox compact and twin pedals are Manufacturer Warrantied for 5 Years, parts and labor, from the date of purchase, for the original user and non-transferable.\n\n- All that is needed, is to submit a Service Repair Request, and submit necessary service info, device, and a copy of your original point of sale purchase receipt/invoice, to honor the Manufacturer Warranty Terms.\nIf outside of warranty terms, the user may choose to have the device serviced/repaired outside of warranty.\nOur Service Techs can provide a service/repair quote for parts and labor, if a repair option is available.\n(Note: Some vintage legacy device pedals/products may not have parts available for service/repair)\n\n* * *\n**Please review our Roland BOSS Manufacturer Warranty Information, create a Roland BOSS Backstage account, register your product and submit a Service Repair Request and use the other self-service tools and weblinks available:**\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/jchHAj757yHujYD2P8NF4bR38/?name=image.png)\n\n* * *\n**WARRANTY INFORMATION**\nRoland BOSS Product Manufacturer Warranty Information:\nhttps://www.roland.com/us/support/service_repair/\n\n**REGISTER PRODUCT**\nRegister your Roland BOSS Product here:\nhttps://www.boss.info/backstage/mygear#register_product\n\n**SERVICE REPAIR REQUEST**\nSubmit a Service Repair Request for Warranty Service by Roland BOSS Factory Service Department.\nhttps://www.boss.info/backstage/support#service_request\n\n**REPAIR STATUS**\nhttps://www.boss.info/backstage/support#repair_status\n\n**PARTS REQUEST**\nhttps://www.boss.info/backstage/support#parts_order_request\n\n**SERVICE CENTER LOCATOR**\nIf your product is within or outside the Manufacturer Warranty terms, you can use one of our Roland BOSS Certified Service Centers nearest you for service repair.

      "msg": "Hello Sheri,\n\nWe apologize for the delay in getting back to you regarding your RD-2000 EX. Scott is away for the time being so we're jumping in here to assist.\n\nHere are the answers to your questions:\n\n_**Somehow I have done something to make Scene 00 not registered.  Please can you tell me how to get it back?**_\n\nUnfortunately it isn't possible to recall a scene that has been deleted. You'll need to register a new scene. Select the Program or Tone you registered as a Scene, and then follow the \"Registering a scene\" procedure outlined in the **Owner's Manual, page 15.**\n\n_**Also, is all editing done within the program and not the scene? If I edit the program, can I easily resave the program into the same scene?**_\n\nScenes are basically just \"favorites\" made up of single Tones or Programs. They're there to give you quick access to your favorite Tones and Programs in a live performance using the large [TONE BUTTONS].\n\nYou can edit Programs, Tones (Tone Designer), or Zones (Zone Edit), as well as Scenes. If you're in a Scene, simply edit the tone using the knobs and volume sliders on the panel. Press and hold [SCENE] and then register the Scene to the same location to overwrite it, or register it to a different Scene. You can also press [MENU] > Program Edit > Zone Edit to edit the tones further.\n\n\n- If you edit the Scene, it will not alter the Program you initially used to save as a Scene. Therefore, if you accidentally overwrite a Scene, it cannot be recalled/recovered. If you've made enough edits to a Scene and wish to save it in a second location, as sort of a backup, you can save it as a Program using the \"SCENE TO PROGRAM\" function. With the Scene selected ([SCENE] button lit), press the [WRITE] button. The \"SCENE TO PROGRAM\" screen appears. Follow the prompts on the screen to store the Scene as a new Program.\n\nThere is a second way to do this, and it's outlined in the **Parameter Guide, page 31.**\n\n\n_**How do I delete a sound within a program?**_\n\nYou can't actually \"delete\" a single sound, you must either select a different one or simply turn OFF/deactivate the sound by press the [S1]-[S8] button that corresponds to the sound you wish to turn off. If the button is unlit, the sound won't play. You could initialize the Program but this will initialize all of the Tones in the Program. Press [MENU] > Program Utility > Initialize.\n\n_**With the USB, can I import saved scenes to a second keyboard? Or can I only import Programs to a second keyboard?**_\n\nIt is only possible to do a full backup of the RD-2000 EX, which can then be loaded into a different RD-2000 EX if desired. You can load the full backup using the \"Backup Load\" procedure, or load a single Program using the \"Program Utility\" > \"Import\" procedure. This will use the same backup file created when you use the \"Backup Save\" procedure. There is no way to export individual Programs, Tones or Scenes.\n\n_**Can a program be copied and saved to also be in another program slot?**_\n\nYes. Press [WRITE] and select a different spot in the list to save the Program.\n\n_**And can a scene be edited without it also making changes to the original program from which it came?**_\n\nYes. If you edit the Program, it will not alter the Scene to which you registered the Program. The Program will remain unchanged and independent of the Scene.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRoland Customer Support\nThis email was written by an actual human being.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, simply reply to this message.\n\n*Please note that we aim to respond within 48 hours.

      "msg": "Hello Sheri,\n\nWe're sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue.\n\nThere shouldn't be any sort of \"popping noise\" when introducing a new sound using one of the sliders.\n\n\n1. Does the noise occur if you use one of the zone buttons to simply turn on/activate the tone rather than using the slider to fade it in? For example, if the slider is up to a medium level, and the zone is OFF/UNLIT, will pressing the zone button so that it is then ON/LIT RED produce the noise as well? Or is it the specific act of fading in with the slider that is causing the noise?\n2. Does this noise occur in every program or scene that you've saved or only specific ones?\n3. Does this noise occur with every tone that you bring in with the slider or only specific ones?\n4. Does this noise occur on any slider you use or only a specific one? **(Basically we're trying to determine if the noise is being caused by the tone, program, scene, or slider)**\n5. Is this a new RD-2000 EX or an RD-2000 that was upgraded to EX with the purchased EX Upgrade software update?\n6. Would it be possible for you to record a video of the issue?\n7. Would you be able to send us a \"BACKUP FILE\" of your RD-2000 EX? We can then load it into ours to see if the issue can be reproduced on different hardware or if it's a software/sound issue.\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/08wHAPdb7y06oO1mdgfCzo6gF/?name=RD-2000EX+Backup.png)\n\nThank you,\n\nRoland Customer Support\nThis email was written by an actual human being.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, simply reply to this message.\n\n*Please note that we aim to respond within 48 hours.

      "msg": "Hello Kira,\n\nWe're sorry to hear that you're having trouble.\n\nWe're a little confused by your setup. To clear up some details, ASIO is a driver protocol that was not developed by Roland. \"Steinberg designed this format to improve latency performance and channel count compared to Windows Audio drivers.\"\n\nhttps://www.sweetwater.com/sweetcare/articles/roland-difference-between-asio-wdm-mme-drivers/\n\nFor the FANTOM-7 EX to transfer audio to and from a DAW like Cubase, you can either:\n\n\n- Use the Roland Fantom Driver that you would install on your Windows computer, set the USB Driver mode to VENDOR and connect it via USB cable to your computer.\n- Connect the physical main output jacks on the FANTOM-7 EX to the inputs of your Clarett interface, and select the Clarett as the audio interface in Cubase to record the FANTOM-7 EX's audio signal.\n\nIt isn't possible to use more than one audio interface at once on a Windows computer. This is possible on a Mac (setting up an daggregate device), but not on Windows.\n\nWe hope this helps.\n\nBest regards,\n\nRoland Customer Support\nThis email was written by an actual human being.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, simply reply to this message.\n\n*Please note that we aim to respond within 48 hours.

Turn on the power.\n2. The version information appears in the lower right corner of the startup display.\nIf this shows the latest version (Version 2.00 or later), there's no need to update your GX-100.\n3. After verifying the displayed version, turn off the power.\n\n**If the firmware update is needed, please have the user use the link to download and follow the Procedure for The Update section.**\n**Review the following instructions for getting your GX-100 updated and connected:**\n\n- First download, extract, and install the latest GX-100 firmware update into your GX-100 when connected in \"update\" mode.\n**GX-100 System Program (Ver.2.03)**\n** **\n- Once the GX-100 firmware has been update to VERSION 2.01, then install the GX-100 USB Device Driver for specific computer OS and Version.\n**=>WINDOWS**\n- **GX-100 Driver Ver.1.0.1 for Windows 10/11**\n\n**=>macOS**\n- **GX-100 Driver Ver.1.0.1 for macOS Big Sur 11.x / Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n\n- Next download, extract, and install the BTS for GX-100 software editor for your specific computer OS and Version:\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 Ver.2.0.1 for Windows**\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 Ver.2.0.1 for macOS**\n\n- If using a sold separate **BT-DUAL adapter for BT pairing and connectivity** download and use the\nBTS for GX-100 mobile device software editor for (Android/iOS mobile devices):\nDownload “BTS for GX-100” for Android\nDownload “BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100” for Windows/macOS\n\n-\n\nFor troubleshooting USB cabling, make sure to use a USB 2.0 A to B printer data cable,\nand connect to a USB 2.0 A port directly on the computer, or if necessary use a USB 2.0 A adapter or USB HUB with a USB 2.0 A port directly on it.\nMany newer macOS computers only have USB-C or USB 3.0 A ports, and the USB 3.0 A ports are sometimes not backwards compatible for USB 2.0.\nHere are some examples of cabling and hub/adapters:\n- Amazon USB 2.0 A to B 10ft cable are affordable and work great.\n- We use a USB-C Totu Adapter for our USB-C only MacBook and works great.\n- Similar simple USB-C to USB 2.0 A adapters.\n\n\n\nThese steps should get the GX-100 firmware updated, USB driver installed for the computer to recognize the hardware,\nand the BTS for GX-100 software editor installed and connected.\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE SEE OUR GX-100 DOWNLOADS AND SUPPORT INFO WEB LINKS BELOW:**\n**GX-100 FEATURES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-100/**\n\n**GX-100 SPECIFICATIONS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-100/specifications/**\n\n**GX-100 ACCESSORIES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-100/accessories/**\n\n* * *\n**GX-100 DOWNLOADS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-100/downloads/**\n\n\n#### **UPDATES & DRIVERS**\n**GX-100 SYSTEM PROGRAM FIRMWARE:**\n\n- **GX-100 System Program (Ver.2.03)**\n\n**GX-100 USB DEVICE DRIVERS:**\n\n**WINDOWS:**\n\n- **GX-100 Driver Ver.1.0.1 for Windows 10/11**\n**macOS:**\n\n- **GX-100 Driver Ver.1.0.1 for macOS Big Sur 11.x / Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n- **GX-100 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS 10.15**\n\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 COMPUTER SOFTWARE EDITOR (WIN/macOS):**\n\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 Ver.2.0.1 for Windows**\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 Ver.2.0.1 for macOS**\n\n- **GX-100 SUPPORT INFO & DOCUMENTATION:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-100/support/**\n\n- **[English] GX-100 Startup Guide**\n- **[English] GX-100 Reference Manual [HTML]**\n- **[English] GX-100 Reference Manual [PDF]**\n- **[English] GX-100 Parameter Guide [HTML]**\n- **[English] GX-100 Parameter Guide [PDF]**\n- **[English] Using BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 [HTML]**\n- **[English] Using BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-100 (mobile) [HTML]**\n- **[English] GX-100/GX-10 MIDI Implementation [PDF]**\n\n* * *\n**GX-100 VIDEO CONTENT:**\n\n**Tom Quayle on GX-100:**\n**https://youtu.be/w9aOZwSbX2I**\n\n* * *\n**GX-100 + BT DUAL FUNCTIONALITY:**\n**https://static.roland.com/manuals/gx-100_reference/eng/17822652.html**\n\n\n* * *\n**BT-DUAL PAIRING TROUBLESHOOTING:**\n\nThe BT-DUAL adapter is necessary for BT/Bluetooth AUDIO and MIDI connection between a BOSS device > and Android/iOS mobile device. The BT-DUAL is installed on the BT-DUAL port, on the top or back panel of the amp/device/product. (See attachment instructions detailed below)\n\nThe BT-DUAL adapter can be purchased and is sold separately with any Roland BOSS dealer, for example:\nhttps://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/BTDual--boss-bt-dual-bluetooth-audio-midi-dual-adapter\nIf the already implementing and using the BT-DUAL, then we can continue with some more instruction on BT connectivity with the BT-DUAL.\n\n**There are two BT/Bluetooth connections to establish when using the BT-DUAL Bluetooth MIDI Adapter for any BOSS amp/device/product:**\n\n\n1. **BT MIDI** : When you first power on the BOSS amp/device, with BT-DUAL connected,\nthe BT-DUAL BLUE LED light flashes slowly, for the BT MIDI / 'DEVICE' MIDI connection.\nUsually the BTS mobile device app will sync automatically, using and establishing the BT MIDI connection.\n\nDownload and install the BTS app for your device, search BTS \"device name\" app for your mobile device on either the Google Play Store (Android) or Apply App Store (iOS):\nFor Android mobile devices: Google Play Store\nFor Apple iOS mobile device:  Apple App Store.\n\nThe user can manually connect using STEP 2, of the BTS/BOSS TONE STUDIO app and connect with the BT MIDI/DEVICE MIDI connection. This connection is for using the BTS software editor app to user edit the patches on the amp/device.\n\n2. **BT AUDIO** : With the BT-DUAL installed on the device, long press and hold the BT-DUAL button, for about 3–5 seconds, the BT-DUAL BLUE LED light flashes BLUE rapidly, and the BT connection is then named BT AUDIO / 'DEVICE' AUDIO connection.\nConnect, using the Android/iOS mobile device System menu > Bluetooth menu, select the BT AUDIO connection to pair and confirm or OK the pairing.\nOnce connected, you can then BT stream and play audio through the amp/device.\nThe connection process is similar to establishing a BT connection with a car stereo, AirPods, BT earbuds, or BT portable speaker, etc.\n\n**NOTE: if having issues connecting or finding the BT MIDI or BT AUDIO, make sure that all other BT devices nearby are deactivated with BT OFF.**\nThis will prevent the connections from being paired with another device, other than the intended device.\nYou may also need to forget the device for certain BT products, in order for it to release the BT connection option.\n\n\n* * *\n**BT-DUAL LINKS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/bluetooth_audio_midi_dual_adaptor/**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/bluetooth_audio_midi_dual_adaptor/specifications/**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/bluetooth_audio_midi_dual_adaptor/support/**\n\n**BT OWNER’S MANUALS**\n\n- **[9 Languages] Bluetooth Audio MIDI Dual Adaptor Owner’s Manual**\n\n**ATTACHING THE BT-DUAL**\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/xSRbwtdWCbw1XQKqEXjMHawu4/?name=image.png)\n\nKind regards",

If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, it’s very important to try and connect to a dedicated USB 2.0 A female type port directly on the computer.\nOften times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\nHowever, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in which case a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter and it provides multiple USB connectivity options most importantly the USB 2.0 A port option.\n\n2. Depending on the BOSS device, connect using either:\n(USB 2.0 A to B printer/data cable)\nFor example used with: KATANA MK1/MK2, KATANA-AIR, GT-1000, GT-100, GT-001, GT-1, GT-1B, SY-300, SY-1000, BOSS RV/DD/MD-500 Series Pedals, GR-55, RC-202, RC-3, RC-30, RC-300, RC-505 MK1, RC-505 MK2, RC-600, JS-10, GP-10, AD-10, VE-8, MS-3, ME-80, GP-10, etc.\n\nOR alternate USB cabling:\n(micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable).\nFor example used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, etc.\n\n(USB C - to A Data Type Cable Option)\n(USB C - to C Data Type Cable Option 2)\nFor example used with: Katana Gen 3, Katana:GO and IR-2.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party security software running please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/HLAyr4WNBqRst4VWKFtUi4Ww0/?name=Screenshot+2024-07-10+at+4.37.54%E2%80%AFPM.png)\n\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

      "msg": "Max,\n\nThanks for reaching out and contacting Roland BOSS USA Operational Product Support about the WAZA-AIR.\nSorry to hear you're having issues.\n\nYou should check a couple of things related to your WL-T transmitter drop out.\n- First check the physical connection of the WL-T transmitter to your GUITAR OUTPUT jack.\nNot all output jacks are the same and not standardized, the jack needs to depress the small on/off pin at the base of the WL-T transmitter. You can press this small pin with your finger to see that it turns the WL-T on/off. When connected for guitar performance, this pin needs to be depressed down all the way continuously for guitar signal to send wirelessly.\n- Check the BTS for WAZA-AIR mobile app SYSTEM > STANDBY/SLEEP MODE settings and configure to OFF or longer duration so that you know the system is not going into standby prematurely.\n- Make sure to always pair up before performance, wireless interference is normal and is different throughout the day, depending on your immediate environment.\nTry not be within proximity to 2.4GHz wireless devices, routers, mobile devices, smart TVs etc. When practicing, you can walk anywhere with the WAZA-AIR, so check some different locations.\nBut remember to always pair up as instructed in the manual:\n- For proper pairing review: **2.4GhZ Wireless Guitar audio connection:** Pair your WL-T Transmitter with the WAZA-AIR HEADSET by mating and connecting the WL-T to the WAZA-AIR Pairing Jack,\n**wait and allow for 10 seconds or LED blinks for proper pairing and CHANNEL selection**, 1 of 14 CHANNELS with the least amount of interference will be selected.\n**Once the LED on the WL-T has gone dim then it has chosen and paired, now separate the WL-T and connect to GUITAR OUTPUT jack for usage.**\n**Here's some additional info for all three connections:**\n**BT/BLUETOOTH WAZA-AIR AUDIO for BT audio app streaming for backing tracks.**\n**BT/BLUETOOTH WAZA-AIR MIDI for BT MIDI app connection and for programming the 6 Channels of the WAZA-AIR.**\n**WIRELESS AUDIO 2.4 GHZ wireless WL-T transmitter to WAZA-AIR wireless guitar signal transmission.**\n\n* * *\n**BOSS WAZA-AIR Explainer Video:**\n**https://youtu.be/izs9DYbty6o**\n\n**PLEASE REVIEW AND EXECUTE ALL STEPS BELOW TO GET PROPERLY CONNECTED WITH YOUR WAZA-AIR DEVICE**\nThe WAZA-AIR is designed to be used for BT WAZA-AIR AUDIO streaming of music for backing track jam along, simultaneously with 2.4 GHz guitar/instrument signal while using the WAZA-AIR BT MIDI for control of the Boss Tone Studio for WAZA-AIR mobile app.\n\nPlease use the support connection instructions provided also for more info and detail use the WAZA-AIR Owner's Manual and Device Connection Addendums below.\n- To start a fresh setup and pairing of your mobile device and WAZA-AIR headphones it's best if you first forget or unpair any BT WAZA-AIR AUDIO or MIDI connections on your mobile device Bluetooth system settings.\n**If you happened to have tried to pair other mobile devices or there are BT mobile devices nearby make sure to clear all paired instances of WAZA-AIR or set other mobile devices Bluetooth: OFF.**\n- Power Off your WAZA-AIR headphones **(2)**.\n- Power ON the WAZA-AIR headphones **(2)**,\nthen long press the Bluetooth button **(7)** for 3-4 seconds,\nthe BLUE LED **(5)** should blink rapidly showing ready for pairing mode.\n- Go to your ANDROID/iOS mobile device BT settings and first pair with **WAZA-AIR AUDIO** for the BT streaming audio connection.\n- Once successfully paired to **WAZA-AIR AUDIO**, open the BTS for WAZA-AIR Software Editor Mobile App and press the **PAIRING: BLUETOOTH MIDI DEVICE** selection **PAIRING BUTTON** and in the **BT MIDI DEVICE CONNECTION** screen choose the **WAZA-AIR MIDI Input / Output** connection from the **BLUETOOTH DEVICES list**,\na small **\"CONNECTING\" message or * asterisk** will appear, use the return/back arrow (Android) or screen tap (iOS) of the mobile device to return to the app **BLUETOOTH PAIRING/CONNECT screen**, connections should now be listed -\n**PAIRING: BLUETOOTH MIDI DEVICE CONNECT: WAZA-AIR MIDI(Bluetooth)**, now press the OK selection button and wait for sync.\n- This should get you connected with both the **WAZA-AIR AUDIO for BT streaming music** and **WAZA-AIR MIDI for app sync control** with the **BOSS TONE STUDIO for WAZA-AIR software editor app**.\n- For **2.4GhZ Wireless Guitar audio connection:** Pair your WL-T Transmitter with the WAZA-AIR HEADSET by mating and connecting the WL-T to the WAZA-AIR Pairing Jack **(9)**, **wait and allow for 10 seconds or LED blinks** **for proper pairing and CHANNEL selection**, 1 of 14 CHANNELS with the least amount of interference will be selected. **Once the LED on the WL-T has gone dim then it has chosen and paired, now separate the WL-T and connect to GUITAR OUTPUT jack for usage.**\n

      "msg": "Bobby,\n\nThanks for reaching out and contacting Roland BOSS USA Operational Product Support about the KATANA-100 GEN 3.\n\nEvery guitar amp will have varying noise floor, which is the noise/sound when idle.\nThis may differ depending on the AMP TYPE chosen and GAIN/VOLUME settings for the KATANA GEN3 amp.\nIf necessary, you can use the BTS for KATANA GEN3 software editor, each Channel is provided an NS/Noise Suppressor, to help gate the noise, whenever not playing.\nSo this is really useful when using high gain amp types and higher gain/volume settings, use the NS set with a higher threshold to gate out the sound, use the decay/release adjustment to make the gate sound more natural upon release, rather than abrupt.\nPANEL mode is like any normal guitar amp, what you see knob wise, is what you hear.\n\nWhile all the other CHANNELS are write/saved preset patches with saved settings.\nWhen switching CHANNELS the knobs will not necessarily indicate what is set, the knobs are not motorized, and can't shift into place for every CHANNEL.\nSo if you touch a knob, it will catch up to that current position, but the actual saved preset value, may be higher or lower than what the knob is actually indicating.\nThis may take some time getting used to, but pretty much you can set your sound, with any of the knobs or software editor, then press hold a CHANNEL to save your settings, if using the editor use the WRITE button to write/save your custom user settings.\n\nYou can use the MASTER LEVEL volume to control the over all output of the amp, however, the POWER CONTROL and MASTER LEVEL can't be write/saved to a CHANNEL, these always remain separate, and for on the fly manual adjustment by hand, the values of POWER CONTROL and MASTER LEVEL, can not be saved to the CHANNEL.\nAll the other parameters can be write/saved to the CHANNEL or patch: AMP TYPE, GAIN, VOLUME, EQ, EFFECTS, PRESENCE, etc., can all be saved to the CHANNEL/PATCH.\n\nWe suggest, using more of your POWER AMP, so use the 50W POWER CONTROL setting, and use the MASTER LEVEL a bit more.\nThen choose your CHANNEL, adjust the AMP TYPE, GAIN and VOLUME, adjust EQ and FX ON/OFF, then save the settings, by holding down the CHANNEL button.\nA quick way of balancing CHANNELS, it to take this same \"template patch\" and save the same settings to all the other CHANNELS.\nOnce all are the same, then start making derivative changes to each CHANNEL, and save accordingly.\nThis may provide more of balanced CHANNELS/patches when switching.\nHowever, keep in mind changing the AMP TYPE, is like changing the modeled amp type, so it may need a GAIN or VOLUME increase/decrease.\n\nHope this all makes sense.\n\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE REVIEW OUR KATANA-100 GEN3 SUPPORT INFO & WEB LINKS BELOW:**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 FEATURES: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 SPECS: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/specifications/**\n\n** KATANA-100 GEN3 GUIDES/ARTICLES: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/articles/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 ACCESSORIES: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/accessories/**\n\n* * *\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 DOWNLOADS: **\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/downloads/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 MOBILE DEVICE APPS FOR ANDROID/IOS:**\n**(NOTE: BT-DUAL ADAPTER NEEDED & SOLD SEPARATELY) **\n**BTS for KATANA Gen 3 Android**\n**BTS for KATANA Gen 3 Apple iOS**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 FIRMWARE UPDATE: **\n\n- **KATANA3 System Program (Ver.1.07)**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 USB DEVICE DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS/macOS:**\n**=>WINDOWS:**\n\n- **KATANA3 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for Windows 10/11**\n**=>macOS:**\n\n- **KATANA3 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n** **\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 BTS SOFTWARE EDITOR FOR WINDOWS/macOS COMPUTER:**\n\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for KATANA Gen3 Ver.1.1.0 for Windows**\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for KATANA Gen3 Ver.1.1.0 for macOS**\n\n* * *\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION:**\n**https://www.boss.info/global/products/katana-100_gen_3/support/**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 STARTUP GUIDE:**\n**KATANA3 STARTUP GUIDE [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 REFERENCE MANUAL:**\n**KATANA3 REFERENCE MANUAL [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 USING BTS FOR KATANA GEN3 SOFTWARE EDITOR GUIDE:**\n**USING BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 (FOR PC) [PDF]**\n**USING BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 (FOR MOBILE) [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA-100 GEN3 CONNECTING BTS FOR KATANA GEN3 iOS/ANDROID APP TO KATANA GUIDE:**\n**CONNECTING THE BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 IOS APP TO THE KATANA UNIT [PDF]**\n**CONNECTING THE BOSS TONE STUDIO FOR KATANA GEN3 ANDROID APP TO THE KATANA UNIT [PDF]**\n\n**KATANA GEN3 FACTORY RESET INSTRUCTIONS:**\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/5JsnKxTaVhrY7aX0SWy0LVkM7/?name=image.png)\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

Initially it is difficult to notice, however they are labeled as \"A\" and \"B.\"  Confirm the A cable is connected to the A jack, and the B cable is connected to the B jack. Connecting them incorrectly can cause the symptom you've described.\n\nIf the connections are correct, you'll want to update the VH-14D with version 1.11 if you have not done so already. After updating, be sure to recalibrate the VH-14D in the TD-27.\nHere is a link to the download;\nhttps://www.roland.com/us/products/vh-14d/downloads/\n\nWe hope this information is helpful.

If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, try and connect to a couple of different ports:\nUSB 2.0/3.0 A or USB-C, female type port directly on the computer.\n- Often times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\n- However, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in some cases a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options most importantly the USB 2.0/3.0 A port options.\n\n2. Depending on the BOSS device, connect using either:\n- A USB B type to USB 2.0 A cable: for old KATANA MKI/MKII\n**- A USB-C to USB-C cable: for new KATANA GEN3**\n**- A USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A cable: for new KATANA GEN3**\nFor example: **https://a.co/d/cmTWOuK**\n\nOR alternate USB cabling for other BOSS devices:\n**(****micro B type USB to USB 2.0 A type data cable****).**\nFor example used with: POCKET-GT, WAZA-AIR, WAZA-AIR BASS, RC-5, RC-10R, RC-500, GT-1000CORE, BOSS DD/EQ/MD/OD/SY-200 Series Pedals, etc.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB 2.0 or micro B type USB cables and try some alternate USB 2.0 A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party or native security software running please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications. Some native security features on both WINDOWS/macOS can block proper connectivity, and app/driver functionality.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/0clHRgOHVre7Alk4Bbh0Rwrsp/?name=inline821420174.png)\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**All instructions are included in the update download link, we'll try to reword them for you to see if it helps:**\n\nOnce you've extracted the zipped download, there should be a folder: **\"katana3_sys_v107\" folder**,\nyou'll need to copy/paste or drag/drop the two update files into the connected KATANA GEN3 amp update drive, when the amp is connected via USB in update mode.\nMake sure to first connect the amp in updater mode as instructed: [Hold down the TAP TEMPO button and power ON], then connect the KATANA via USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0A cable to your computer USB port.\nThe KATANA should connect and appear as an external drive, on your desktop: **KATANA3(DRIVE:).**\nYou'll then need to copy/paste or drag/drop the two update files: **KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT** files into/onto the drive.\nOnce copied over to the KATANA3(DRIVE:), you can soft-eject the drive by dragging it to the Trash (for macOS only) or right mouse click EJECT (works for WINDOWS/macOS).\nThen disconnect USB cable, this should start the update process, if it doesn't, then turn toward the amp and press the blinking RED LED PANEL button, manually if necessary. This will execute the update and will take about a minute to complete.\n\nOnce completed you should see all EFFECTS LEDS blinking GREEN simultaneously together showing a successful update.\nIf the EFFECT LEDs blink RED rapidly then the update was a failure and you'll need to try again.\n\nIn either situation, power OFF to exit updater mode and power back ON.\n\n* * *\n**PROCEDURE FOR THE UPDATE**\nCaution\n\n- You must not rename the extracted files.\n- Never turn off the KATANA GEN3's power while the update is in progress.\nOtherwise the system program or the KATANA GEN3 itself may be destroyed.\n\n**PROCEDURE FOR THE UPDATE**\n**Caution**\n\n- You must not rename the extracted file.\n- Never turn off the KATANA's power while the update is in progress. Otherwise the system program or the KATANA itself may be destroyed.\nPlease install the extracted system program files into your KATANA according to the following procedure.\n\n1. Adjust the [MASTER] knob to minimum.\n* Do not connect the KATANA and the computer yet.\n2. Turn the POWER switch on while holding down the [TAP] button.\nThe indicators for the [EFFECTS] buttons flash.\n3. Connect the computer to the KATANA's USB port by a USB cable.\n\"KATANA3\" drive appears on the computer screen.\n4. Open the KATANA3 icon.\n\"Removable Disk (*:)\" may appear instead of the KATANA3 icon.\n5. Copy (drag and drop) all the files included in the \"katana3_sys_v107.zip\" folder into the \"KATANA3\" icon.\n* Do not copy the \"katana3_sys_v107\" FOLDER.\nWith Windows\nRight-click on the \"KATANA3\" icon in My Computer (or the \"Removable Disk (*:)\" icon) and execute \"Eject.\"\nWith macOS\nDrag the \"KATANA3\" icon to the Trash icon in the Dock.\n6. Disconnect the USB cable, start the update process.\n7. While the update is in progress, the \"EFFECTS\" indicators light up.\nWhen the update has finished, the \"EFFECTS\" indicators slowly flash simultaneously.\n8. Turn the KATANA3 power off.\n\nThis completes the update operation. The new system program runs at the next startup.\nFollow the procedure for verifying the version to verify that the version has been updated.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\nWe'll further explain the instructions provided in the Procedure for Update here:\n\n- **KATANA3 System Program (Ver.1.07)**\n- Set the KATANA-50/100/ARTIST GEN3 amp to \"updater mode\" by starting with amp OFF,\nPress and hold the [TAP] button, while powering ON the KATANA GEN3 amp.\n- Connect the USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A data cable from KATANA USB-C port to computer USB-C/ 2.0/3.0 A port.\nBlinking RED CHANNEL LEDs should be visible if not connected,\nSolid RED CHANNEL LEDs should be visible if already connected with the USB cable to computer.\n\nThe KATANA3(DRIVE:) should mount and appear on computer:\n- For WINDOWS KATANA3(DRIVE:) should appear in the WINDOWS FILE EXPLORER WINDOW left column.\n- For macOS the KATANA3 Drive Icon should appear on the desktop or in the FINDER.\n\nMake sure to download the update zip folder to your local drive and extract all the contents to your desktop, open the **katana3_sys_v107 folder, does not need to be extracted.**\nIf necessary RIGHT MOUSE CLICK the download and EXTRACT ALL to the DOWNLOADS folder or DESKTOP: ***katana3_sys_v107.zip (Compressed/zipped folder) needs to be EXTRACTED.**\nNOTE: macOS will automatically extract an unzip the download into the DOWNLOADS folder, open folder, use the two update files: **KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT** files.\nUser doesn't need to OPEN these files, only drag/drop or copy/paste these files into the mounted external KATANA3(DRIVE:).\n*For WINDOWS users, right-mouse click the zip then select Extract All, follow the instructions and extract to your desktop or know location.\nSee side by side of the ZIPPED(highlighted) vs. extracted unzipped folder:\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/vezQ7t0wJZHhlMnmIy4a6KgiD/?name=image.png)\n**Already extracted, open folder: Select copy/paste or drag/drop the two files KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT files into the  KATANA3(DRIVE:) manually.**\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/KQeDHNUFeTwLEJKE1iOCpxgAR/?name=image.png)\nWhen doing the update, make sure to copy/paste, drag/drop only the two update files into the KATANA3(DRIVE:).\n**Again, use both the KATANA3.BIN and ROMINFO.TXT files for the update.**\nNOT the zipped folder, or the extracted folder, ONLY these two update files should be added to the KATANA3(DRIVE:).\nOnce the update files are copied over into the KATANA3(DRIVE:) and only the two update files, soft-eject the KATANA3(DRIVE:), by Right Mouse Clicking, the KATANA3(DRIVE:) and choose EJECT.\nThen disconnect the USB-C to USB 2.0/3.0 A cable from the computer or amp.\n\nThis will trigger the amp to recognize the update and you'll see the KATANA GEN3 amp, start the update process automatically, if it doesn't, then press the PANEL button with the RED flashing LED.\nIf necessary, press the PANEL LED button once and this will execute the update firmware code you've added to the amp.\nWait about a minute for the update to complete, check for slow blinking **GREEN EFFECT LEDS for successful update.**\nOnce the update has been confirmed, power OFF, and power ON, complete.\n\nAfter attempting the update:\n- If the EFFECT LEDS are flashing GREEN slowly simultaneously together, this indicates the update was a success.\n- If the EFFECTS LEDS are flashing RED rapidly, this indicates the update failed and you'll need to try the process again.\nIn either circumstance/result, you'll need to recycle power, power OFF and back ON again to leave the \"updater mode.\"\n\nIt's ok to power OFF the amp after the update processes has run and completed.\nHowever, DON'T power OFF the amp while it's transmitting the update or in the process of updating.\n\n* * *\n\n* * *\n**KATANA GEN3 FACTORY RESET INSTRUCTIONS:**\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/2PtLEtfq5Ch5kSdIwXovvCrHp/?name=inline1560582286.png)\n\n**ATTACHING THE BT-DUAL ADAPTER INSTRUCTIONS:**\n ![](https://support.roland.com/attachments/token/hnk3slgafbjrm4MMWt18mcenb/?name=image.png)\n\n\n\n\n\nKind regards",

If our attached guidelines are not followed, any occurrence of damage through inadequate packaging will void the product's warranty and will be returned unrepaired.\n\nRoland UK (Ltd)\nAtlantic Close\nSwansea\nSA7 9FJ\n\nFor hygiene reasons, we can only accept clean and suitable items for our Service Team to work on.\n\nThe average turnaround for a warranty repair is 14-28 working days. However, like many other electronic companies, we are currently experiencing long delays with spare parts that can cause delays out of our control. Therefore, if the parts required to repair your unit are not in stock, we will need to order them from Japan, which could delay the repair by 6-8 weeks.\n\nPlease provide me with the tracking number once you have sent it.\n\nIf you have any other questions, please let me know.\n\nKind regards\n\n\nConcha\nCustomer Service\n\nRoland Europe Group Ltd",

Problema con il salvataggio della patch:**\nPotresti gentilmente chiarire se il problema riguarda:\n\n- la _selezione dello strumento COSM_ (ad esempio tipo di chitarra, pickup, accordatura ecc.)\noppure\n- il fatto che il _modulo COSM Guitar_ risulti disattivato (in stato OFF) quando richiami la patch?\nQuesta distinzione ci aiuterebbe a capire meglio se si tratta di un problema di memorizzazione dei parametri o semplicemente dello stato attivo/disattivo del modulo.\n\n**2. Uso del pedale d’espressione per attivare/disattivare un suono PCM specifico:**\nEcco una procedura adattata che ti permette di controllare solo _uno_ dei due suoni PCM con il pedale e di disattivare tutto il resto:\n\n1. Premi **EDIT**.\n2. Premi **PAGE** finché non arrivi alla schermata **TONE**.\n3. Usa i cursori **DOWN** e **LEFT** per spostarti sull’icona a forma di rettangolo alla sinistra di “NORMAL PICKUP”.\n4. Gira la manopola per attivarlo. Quando è attivo, apparirà un quadratino bianco nel rettangolo.\n5. Premi **PAGE** fino a **SYSTEM**.\n6. Usa il cursore per selezionare **PEDAL/GK CONTROL** e premi **ENTER**.\n7. Premi **PAGE** fino alla sezione **EXP** (pedale d’espressione).\n8. Alla voce **EXP FUNCTION**, seleziona **TONE VOLUME**.\n9. Ora scendi alle voci **PCM1**, **PCM2**, **MODELING TONE** e **NORMAL PU**, e imposta:\n  - Il modulo PCM che _vuoi controllare_ su **ON** (es. PCM1 = ON),\n  - Tutti gli altri su **OFF** (es. PCM2 = OFF, MODELING TONE = OFF, NORMAL PU = OFF).\n\nIn questo modo, il pedale controllerà solo il volume del suono PCM scelto. Quando il pedale è abbassato al minimo, il suono sarà muto, e quando lo alzi, verrà progressivamente attivato.\n\nFammi sapere se qualcosa non è chiaro o se vuoi associare questo comportamento a un’altra funzione (es. mute/attiva a scatto).\n\nCordiali saluti,\n\nDaniel\nRoland Customer Support",

      "msg": "Bonjour Lukas,\nMerci de nous avoir contactés, j'espère que vous allez bien.\nJe suis vraiment désolé pour les problèmes que vous rencontrez avec votre Bridge Cast.\nNous allons examiner cela, veuillez vérifier les points ci-dessous.\n\nBruit blanc.\nLorsque le niveau du canal est augmenté alors que la prise AUX n'est pas utilisée, vous pouvez entendre un bruit blanc. Lorsque vous n'utilisez pas la prise AUX, réglez le niveau du canal au minimum ou coupez le son.\nLe bruit capté par le microphone (bruit de fond) peut être supprimé à l'aide de la fonction de suppression du bruit. Activez la suppression du bruit. Si le bruit persiste même lorsque la suppression du bruit est activée, réglez les paramètres de la suppression du bruit. Pour plus d'informations sur les paramètres de suppression du bruit, consultez le manuel d'utilisation du BRIDGE CAST, à la section « Calibrage de la qualité sonore du micro (nettoyage) ».\n\nSuppression du bruit.\nLe suppresseur de bruit intégré au BRIDGE CAST peut ne pas fonctionner correctement s'il est activé en même temps que la fonction de suppression du bruit de votre logiciel de chat (Discord, Zoom, etc.). Si votre voix est également supprimée de manière involontaire, désactivez cette fonction sur l'un des deux appareils.\nBRIDGE CAST : le suppresseur de bruit intégré ne fonctionne pas correctement.\n\nUSB.\nVeuillez vous assurer que vous utilisez un câble USB qui transfère des données et qu'il est branché directement sur un port USB de votre PC. Il peut être utile d'essayer plusieurs câbles. Les hubs USB peuvent causer des interférences avec la communication vers votre PC ; la connexion doit être directe. De plus, s'il s'agit d'un ordinateur de bureau, veuillez essayer d'utiliser l'un des ports à l'arrière de la tour, afin qu'il soit connecté directement à la carte mère de votre PC.\n\nPilote.\nVeuillez vous assurer que le bon pilote est installé. Si c'est le cas, il serait également utile de le désinstaller et de le réinstaller. Il est nécessaire pour la communication avec votre PC.\n\n- Pilote USB BRIDGE CAST Ver.1.0.0 pour Windows 10/11\n- Pilote USB BRIDGE CAST Ver.1.0.1 pour macOS Sonoma 14.x\n- Pilote BRIDGE CAST USB Ver.1.0.0 pour macOS Big Sur 11.x / Monterey 12.x / Ventura 13.x\n\nMicrologiciel.\nLe micrologiciel doit être à jour afin de minimiser les problèmes. Vous pouvez vérifier la version actuelle et télécharger la dernière mise à jour ici si nécessaire.\nProgramme système BRIDGE CAST ( Ver.2.00 )\n\nRéinitialisation d'usine.\nVeuillez essayer une réinitialisation d'usine, car cela peut résoudre de nombreux problèmes.\nTR-8S : Réinitialisation d'usine\n\nVidéo.\nSi aucune des solutions ci-dessus ne fonctionne, pourriez-vous enregistrer une vidéo illustrant le problème ? Une courte vidéo enregistrée avec votre téléphone suffira, cela nous aiderait beaucoup de voir le problème. Pourriez-vous inclure dans la vidéo les connexions que vous avez établies avec le Bridge Cast ? Vous pouvez m'envoyer un lien via WeTransfer ou un autre site web de transfert de fichiers gratuit, car le fichier est probablement trop volumineux pour être joint à un e-mail.\n\nJ'espère que l'une de ces solutions fonctionnera, sinon, nous serons au moins plus près de la solution.\nN'hésitez pas à me contacter si vous avez d'autres questions entre-temps.\nCordialement,\n\nPete\n\nCustomer Service\n\nRoland Europe Group Ltd",

      "msg": "Hello Hae Yoon,\n\nThanks for contacting us!\n**Introduction to a Pro Membership. **\n\nCongratulations on purchasing a Roland Cloud Pro membership!\n\nA Pro membership gives you access to **three** plug-ins at any given time: Zenology, and any **two** Legendary or AIRA series plugins of your choosing, using the **Pro Access switch** in the Cloud Manager Library.\n\n**Any other available plug-in will stay in demo mode** _**until**_ **it's turned on using the Pro Access switch.**\n\nHere’s a list of the Legendary and AIRA series plugins available to you with a Pro membership:\n\n\nD-50, JD-800, JUNO-106, JUNO-60, JUNO-60 CHORUS, JUPITER-4, JUPITER-8, JV-1080, JX-3P, PROMARS, SH-101, SH-2, SOUND CANVAS VA, SYSTEM-100, TB-303, TR-606, TR-707, TR-727, TR808, TR-909, XV-5080, SYSTEM-8 (AIRA), SYSTEM-1 (AIRA)\n\n\nPlease note that the SRX plugins are not included in a Pro membership.\n\nTo choose your two Legendary series plugins, make sure that you have v3.0 of Cloud Manager installed.\n\nTurn off the \"Show Only Owned/Free\" switch by moving it to the left.\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ytXG6RrMagUm6w8sFuwwyzbvt/?name=Screen+Shot+2023-03-14+at+1.55.45+PM.png)\n\nNext follow these steps:\n\n\n1. Go to My Library\n2. Click Series and choose either Legendary or AIRA from the drop down menu.\n3. Click Type, then choose Plug-in.\n4. You'll then see the Pro Access switches to let you choose your two Legendary plug-ins. The same process works for the AIRA instruments (System-8 and System-1).\n\nSee this example:\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/YgJtTiovVfdiBfkLIns4qCJUD/?name=Screen+Shot+2023-03-14+at+9.51.50+AM.png)\n\n\n**Remember**--if you've already got two instruments selected, you'll need to deselect at least one of those before you can select and install/update another instrument.\n\nIf you’re not sure which instruments you’ve already selected, just open Cloud Manager, go to the Library, and filter on “Series: Legendary”. Anything with a blue switch has been selected and is available for use in your DAW or other plugin host software. Anything without a blue switch can’t be authorized, installed or updated.\n\nPlease see the attached video for a demonstration of selecting and changing plugins with the Pro Access switch.\n\n\n\nRegards,\n\nTravis",

Just so we can rule out any incompatibilities, which one is it?\n\nI will need to test this out in person, unfortunately my MD-200 is in the office and I'm working from home today, though I will be in for the rest of the week.\n\nHowever, it seems to me that you would need to set the below settings on both memories. Please open the menu ( Press the [TAP DIVISION] button and [MEMORY] button simultaneously. )\n\nSet this symbol - ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/mNaWLglKJVD4kDco0KkCepF7Y/?name=image.png) to Memory\n\nAnd set this to ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/ZKfjZr65fXa0j8G8s9FcJ1mZ6/?name=image.png) to ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/f1A9yzxR27WHn4xKvPyGQ1zhy/?name=image.png)\n\nThen save the memory, as shown below.\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/xGTLnywuUnl0zo9hylWEAacCY/?name=image.png)\n\nThen repeat this process on the next memory, swapping out the expression pedal's function to what you would like it to do in the second memory.\nIt might be a problem of when you are saving the memory, so it would be worth the order you are trying this.\nPlease let me know if this works or not and I will try and re-create your setup as closely as possible when testing it myself.\n\nIn regards to your second question about the memory ranges, there's a setting for this in the menu ( Press the [TAP DIVISION] button and [MEMORY] button simultaneously. )\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/cW09cCtakw2RwIUuHLdKiVAQV/?name=image.png)\nSo if you set the 'extent to' to 127 you will have the full range of these memories to use.\n\nPlease let me know how you get on with the above and which pedal you are using, we can see the next steps from there.\nBest Regards,\n\nPete\n\nCustomer Service\n\nRoland Europe Group Ltd",

Turn the volume to 0 on your amplifier, then slowly raise the volume of your output device until the vocal sound can be heard clearly without feedback.\n\nBelow is a Google search link on balancing Gain, Volume and Level of any microphone.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=tips+on+balancing+mic+gain%2C+volume+and+level&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS913US913&oq=tips+on+balancing+mic+gain%2C+volume+and+level&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigATIHCAIQIRigATIHCAMQIRigATIHCAQQIRiPAjIHCAUQIRiPAtIBCDg2ODJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\n\nHope this helps.\n\n* * *\n\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

It’s as if the memory state check happens before a button-state check and all processes stop once the memory’s discovered to be damaged.\n\n\n\nI tried to check the content of the CF card but it hung my computer (2020 MacBook Pro with four thunderbolt 3 ports running Sequoia 15.5).  This had happened before and the only way to rescue the card was to boot the Mac into Recovery mode and use the Disk Utility to erase it, re-format it to a PC standard then re-format it using the SPD-S.  Unfortunately however, I can now no longer use the SPD-S to format the card as it won’t get beyond the “memory damaged!” error.\n\n\n\nWith the CF card completely blank and formatted to MS-DOS (FAT) using the Mac’s recovery mode disk utility, I copied the v1.20 SPD-S.PRG file to the card’s root and re-tried the update.  After the “Card Updater” prompt appeared I pressed [PATCH] and [PHRASE MAKER] together but, instead of beginning the update process, all of the front panel LEDs illuminated and error message “Update ERROR 14” appeared in the display with none of the buttons responding.  Power-cycling the unit returned it to the “memory damaged!’ message.\n\n\n\nI went back to the Mac’s recovery disk utility and erased and formatted as ExFAT, but this only gets as far as the “Card Updater” message.  Pressing the flashing [PATCH] and [PHRASE MAKER] buttons has no effect.\n\n\n\nI now have a CF card which is probably formatted incorrectly and no way of correctly formatting it to attempt further uploads.\n\n\n\nCould you advise a further course of action please?  Is there a way I can roll-back the software to the previous version?

You'll want to first, download, and install the firmware update on your GX-10:\n**GX-10 System Program (Ver. 1.02)**\n\n2. Then download, and install the GX-10 USB device driver for your macOS computer:\n**GX-10 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n\n3. Finally, download, and install the BTS for GX-10 software editor for your macOS computer:\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 Ver.1.0.0 for macOS**\n\nOnce the updated and USB device driver installed on your macOS computer, Logic Pro, will recognize the GX-10 as a DAW audio input/output interface in Logic Pro System Preferences\nUse the GX-10 to connect a guitar/bass to input and record to a Track in your Logic Pro session on an audio track armed and enabled for the same GX-10 Input.\nUse headphones, connected to the GX-10 headphones output, to monitor your Logic Pro recording session.\n\n* * *\n**First, do a firmware version check on your GX-10:**\n\n**HOW TO KNOW THE VERSION**\n\nBefore you start, check the system program version of your GX-10.\n\n1.\n\nTurn on the power.\n\n2.\n\nThe version information appears in the lower right corner of the startup display.\nIf this shows the latest version (Version 1.02 or later), there's no need to update your GX-10.\n\n3.\n\nAfter verifying the displayed version, turn off the power.\n\n\nIf the firmware update is needed, please have the user use the link to download and follow the Procedure for The Update section.\n\nReview the following instructions for getting your GX-10 updated and connected:\n\n- First download, extract, and install the latest GX-10 firmware update into your GX-10 when connected in \"update\" mode.\n**GX-10 System Program (Ver. 1.02)**\n\n- Once the GX-10 firmware has been update to VERSION 1.02, then install the GX-10 USB Device Driver for specific computer OS and Version.\n**=>WINDOWS**\n- **GX-10 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for Windows 10/11**\n\n**=>macOS**\n- **GX-10 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n\n- Next download, extract, and install the BTS for GX-10 software editor for your specific computer OS and Version:\n**BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 Ver.1.0.0 for Windows**\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 Ver.1.0.0 for macOS**\n\n-\n\nFor troubleshooting USB cabling, make sure to use a USB 2.0 A to B printer data cable, and connect to a USB 2.0 A port directly on the computer, or if necessary use a USB 2.0 A adapter or USB HUB with a USB 2.0 A port directly on it. Many newer macOS computers only have USB-C or USB 3.0 A ports, and the USB 3.0 A ports are sometimes not backwards compatible for USB 2.0.\nHere are some examples of cabling and hub/adapters:\n- USB C - to A Data Type Cable Option\n\n-  USB C - to C Data Type Cable Option 2\n- We use a USB-C Totu Adapter for our USB-C only MacBook and works great.\n- Similar simple USB-C to USB 2.0 A adapters.\n\nThese steps should get the GX-10 firmware updated, USB driver installed for the computer to recognize the hardware, and the BTS for GX-10 software editor installed and connected.\n\n* * *\n**PLEASE SEE OUR GX-10 SUPPORT INFO AND WEB LINKS BELOW: **\n\n**GX-10 FEATURES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-10/features/**\n\n**GX-10 SPECS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-10/specifications/**\n\n**GX-10 ACCESSORIES:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-10/accessories/**\n\n* * *\n**GX-10 DOWNLOADS:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/gx-10/downloads/**\n\n**GX-10 FIRMWARE UPDATE:**\n**GX-10 System Program (Ver.1.02)**\n\n**GX-10 USB DEVICE DRIVERS (WINDOWS/macOS):**\n**=>WINDOWS DRIVERS:**\n\n- **GX-10 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for Windows 10/11**\n**=>macOS DRIVERS:**\n\n- **GX-10 Driver Ver.1.0.0 for macOS Ventura 13.x / Sonoma 14.x / Sequoia 15.x**\n\n**BTS for GX-10 SOFTWARE EDITOR (WINDOWS/MACOS):**\n\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 Ver.1.0.0 for Windows**\n- **BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 Ver.1.0.0 for macOS**\n\n**BT/BLUETOOTH MOBILE DEVICE SOFTWARE EDITOR (ANDROID/iOS):**\n**Download “BTS for GX-10” for iOS**\n**Download “BTS for GX-10” for Android**\n\n**NOTE: BT-DUAL IS** **SOLD SEPARATELY** **AND NECESSARY FOR BT FUNCTIONALITY:**\n**https://www.boss.info/us/products/bluetooth_audio_midi_dual_adaptor/**\n\n* * *\n**GX-10 SUPPORT DOCUMENTATION**\n\n**GX-10 OWNER'S MANUALS:**\n\n- **[English] GX-10 Startup Guide [PDF]**\n\n- **[English] GX-10 Reference Manual [HTML]**\n- **[English] GX-10 Reference Manual [PDF]**\n\n**GX-10 PARAMETER GUIDE:**\n\n- **[English] GX-10 Parameter Guide [HTML]**\n- **[English] GX-10 Parameter Guide [PDF]**\n\n**BTS for GX-10 MANUAL GUIDE:**\n\n- **[English] BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 Owner’s Manual [HTML]**\n- **[English] BOSS TONE STUDIO for GX-10 (mobile) [HTML]**\n\n**GX-10 BT/BLUETOOTH COMPATIBLE ACCESSORIES:**\n\n- **[English] EV-1-WL Connection Guide (Connect with the GX-10) [PDF]**\n- **[English] FS-1-WL Connection Guide (Connect with the GX-10) [PDF]**\n\n**GX-10 MIDI IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:**\n\n- **[English] GX-100/GX-10 MIDI Implementation [PDF]**\n\n**GX-10 KNOWLEDGE BASE ARTICLES:**\n**https://support.roland.com/hc/en-us/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=GX-10**\n\n- **GX-10: Applying Effects to Dry Sound after Recording (Re-amping)**\n- **GX-10: What does the USB Computer port allow me to do with the GX-10?**\n\n\n\n\nKind regards",

      "msg_o": "Good afternoon, I purchased my ME-90 in November from Anderton's UK and have been using it professionally every day since with no issue.\nOver the last 2 weeks though, in the middle of shows, I experienced a couple of issues.\nThe first issue was May 31st in the middle of a show, the pedal (which was plugged in with a BOSS power supply) shut itself off randomly and wouldn't come back on until I unplugged the power unit from the strip it was in and into a different one.\nSo, I thought I was dealing with a dodgy power strip.\n\nOn the 7th of this month, however, throughout the duration of a 1.5 hour long show, the pedal was turning itself up in volume randomly, without being touched by me.\nSometimes, if I changed patch the volume was instantly louder than it should have been, other times, I could see the numbers actually changing on the LED screen as the volume increased quickly. At this point, it was plugged in through the same BOSS power supply and, once again, I moved the power supply to a different power strip, but that did not resolve the issue.\n\nWhat seemed to resolve it in this particular show was turning the machine off, wiggling the output volume knob, the EQ Level knob and the Preamp Level knob, turning the machine back on and resuming the show. I didn't have an issue after that, but then again, only had 3 songs left in the show at that point.\n\nAt the hotel the next day before another show, I cleaned the pedal quite well, removing the knob covers and making sure they all turned with no issue.\nI also put batteries in the machine and played that night's show with no issues. (I did not plug the machine in through power that night)\n\nThis morning, I have updated the machine's firmware.\n\nI have not yet seen the issue return, but then again, its hard to recreate the situation, as I'm not on a big live stage with huge sound and the power supply in my rehearsal room has never given me any issues.\n\nI wondered if you could shed any light on this for me?\n\n\nProduct Name: ME-90\nSerial Number: A4Q4456\nPurchase Date: 2024-11-24\nPurchase Method: Online\nPurchase Dealer: Andertons Music (Guildford)",

Na assistência técnica HTEC natal RN, após avaliação informaram.que precisava trocar a placa principal. Mas que a garantia da placa é de apenas 3 meses. Esta informação procede? Como o orçamento equivale a quase 1/3 do valor que comprei o piano não sei se vale a pena o reparo. Fiquei de fato decepcionada pois achei que a durabilidade de um piano da marca Roland era maior. Por isso não comprei outras marcas mais baratas na época. Uso apenas em minha casa. Resolvi aprender a tocar depois que me aposentei. Tenho aulas semanais online e pratico em torno de 4 vezes por semana. Mantenho ele sempre coberto pra não pegar poeira.

After an evaluation at the HTEC Natal RN technical assistance center, they informed me that the main board needed to be replaced. However, the warranty for the board is only 3 months. Is this information correct? Since the quote is almost 1/3 of the price I paid for the piano, I don't know if it's worth the repair. I was really disappointed because I thought that a Roland piano would last longer. That's why I didn't buy other cheaper brands at the time. I only use it at home. I decided to learn to play after I retired. I have weekly online lessons and practice around 4 times a week. I always keep it covered so that it doesn't get dusty. In other words, I use it sparingly and carefully.\n\n Thank you in advance for your attention.\n\n Greetings\n Dione\n Product Category: Pianos\n Product: No Data\n Cell Phone Number: No Data\n ZIP Code: 59015-450",

If your Roland BOSS device connects to a desktop computer via USB, it’s very important to try and connect to a dedicated USB 2.0 A female type port directly on the computer.\nOften times, USB ports on the front of computers and those on monitors and QWERTY keyboards are considered hubs, and are not recommended for proper Roland BOSS device USB connectivity.\nHowever, some newer computers only have USB 3.0 or USB-C ports available, in which case a USB hub adapter may be necessary. We test and use the following USB hub adapter, and it provides multiple USB connectivity options, most importantly the USB 2.0 A port option.\n\n2. (USB C - to A Data Type Cable Option)\n(USB C - to C Data Type Cable Option 2)\nFor example, used with: Katana Gen 3, Katana:GO and IR-2.\n\nNote: Not all USB cables are the same, some are for charging only and not for data.\nIf necessary, when troubleshooting connectivity, try some alternate USB or USB-C type USB cables and try some alternate USB A compatible ports on computer or USB hub.\n\n3. If you have any onboard computer 3rd party security software running, please disable/disarm them temporarily while attempting to connect your Roland BOSS device along with software editor applications.\nAlso, temporarily disconnect any 3rd party USB interfaces or devices that may impede your Roland BOSS device connectivity.\n\nVisual images of USB type connections for proper cable identification:\n\n ![](https://rolandus.zendesk.com/attachments/token/IubCIzk0lsWmBALEPnFHQ43nh/?name=inline-1581383714.png)\n\n\n* * *\n\nThanks and enjoy your day.\nRoland/BOSS Product Support",

There is no postal service available at our service location, SO PLEASE DO NOT SHIP VIA USPS. Please make sure signature is required for package delivery.\n\nPersonnel at this address are not authorized to receive repairs directly from customers. Any attempt to drop off units will be rejected.\n\nPlease write your RA# clearly on the outside of the shipping box underneath the address. If this is a warranty repair, please place a copy of your sales receipt inside the box. We recommend that you insure your KATANA-MINI with your shipping carrier to cover any accidental damage or loss that may occur in the shipping process.\n\nFor non-warranty repairs, we will contact you with an estimate after we have inspected your KATANA-MINI. In most cases this will be 3-5 business days after we receive it.\n\nKind Regards,\nRoland Service Department",

Wichtig ist außerdem, dass das andere Kabelende zu Ihrem Computeranschluss passt – in der Regel ist das entweder USB-A (klassischer USB-Anschluss) oder ebenfalls USB-C, je nach Modell Ihres PCs oder Laptops.\n\nBeispiel:\n\n- Wenn Ihr Computer einen klassischen USB-Anschluss hat, benötigen Sie ein USB-C auf USB-A-Kabel (mit Datenübertragung).\n- Wenn Ihr Computer über einen USB-C-Anschluss verfügt, können Sie ein USB-C auf USB-C-Kabel verwenden (ebenfalls mit Datenübertragung).\n\nBitte achten Sie beim Kauf darauf, dass das Kabel ausdrücklich für Datenübertragung geeignet ist, da einige USB-C-Kabel nur für das Laden von Geräten ausgelegt sind und in diesem Fall nicht funktionieren würden.\n\nBei weiteren Fragen helfen wir Ihnen gerne weiter!\n\nMit freundlichen Grüßen\n\nDaniel\nRoland Customer Support",

I'd like to play this file (a drum track) as accompaniment, i.e., &quot;call it up&quot; via the looper (RC-500), and then, of course, also hear it through the Katana.\n\n\n\n I don't imagine it's particularly complicated, I hope I'm not mistaken. So how do I proceed?\n\n Would you please be so kind as to describe the correct procedure – step by step?\n\n As already described above, it's simply a matter of importing a WAV file into the looper or the sound studio software so that you can then use it for accompaniment or play (listen) it through the Katana.\n\n\n\n Thank you very much in advance.\n\n Best regards from Switzerland\n\n Peter Korner",

In this case, troubleshooting Ableton will be needed.\n\nPlease let us know how it goes!\n\nKind regards,\nRoland Customer Support",

Perhaps if you're not fully depressing the switch, it isn't registering a long press for the tuner. So it may toggle memory/manual mode. If you even lift your foot slightly, it may register this change rather than engage the tuner.\n\nIf you let go early, the ME-90B may start to think you're trying to navigate patches, not activate the tuner. This may be why pressing it again, even briefly then holding is giving you the tuner. Ergo, resetting the function.\n\nIf you like, you can send over a quick video that demonstrates what you're seeing and I'd be happy to take a closer look.\n\nKind regards,\n\nHuw\n\nCustomer Service\n\nRoland Europe Group Ltd",

      "msg": "Dan,\n\nThanks for reaching out and contacting Roland BOSS USA Operational Product Support about the WAZA-AIR.\n\nYou should check a couple of things related to your WL-T transmitter drop out.\n- First check the physical connection of the WL-T transmitter to your GUITAR OUTPUT jack.\nNot all output jacks are the same and not standardized, the jack needs to depress the small on/off pin at the base of the WL-T transmitter. You can press this small pin with your finger to see that it turns the WL-T on/off. When connected for guitar performance, this pin needs to be depressed down all the way continuously for guitar signal to send wirelessly.\n- Check the BTS for WAZA-AIR mobile app SYSTEM > STANDBY/SLEEP MODE settings and configure to OFF or longer duration so that you know the system is not going into standby prematurely.\n- Make sure to always pair up before performance, wireless interference is normal and is different throughout the day, depending on your immediate environment.\nTry not be within proximity to 2.4GHz wireless devices, routers, mobile devices, smart TVs etc. When practicing, you can walk anywhere with the WAZA-AIR, so check some different locations.\nBut remember to always pair up as instructed in the manual:\n- For proper pairing review: **2.4GhZ Wireless Guitar audio connection:** Pair your WL-T Transmitter with the WAZA-AIR HEADSET by mating and connecting the WL-T to the WAZA-AIR Pairing Jack,\n**wait and allow for 10 seconds or LED blinks for proper pairing and CHANNEL selection**, 1 of 14 CHANNELS with the least amount of interference will be selected.\n**Once the LED on the WL-T has gone dim then it has chosen and paired, now separate the WL-T and connect to GUITAR OUTPUT jack for usage.**\n**Here's some additional info for all three connections:**\n**BT/BLUETOOTH WAZA-AIR AUDIO for BT audio app streaming for backing tracks.**\n**BT/BLUETOOTH WAZA-AIR MIDI for BT MIDI app connection and for programming the 6 Channels of the WAZA-AIR.**\n**WIRELESS AUDIO 2.4 GHZ wireless WL-T transmitter to WAZA-AIR wireless guitar signal transmission.**\n\n* * *\n**BOSS WAZA-AIR Explainer Video:**\n**https://youtu.be/izs9DYbty6o**\n\n**PLEASE REVIEW AND EXECUTE ALL STEPS BELOW TO GET PROPERLY CONNECTED WITH YOUR WAZA-AIR DEVICE**\nThe WAZA-AIR is designed to be used for BT WAZA-AIR AUDIO streaming of music for backing track jam along, simultaneously with 2.4 GHz guitar/instrument signal while using the WAZA-AIR BT MIDI for control of the Boss Tone Studio for WAZA-AIR mobile app.\n\nPlease use the support connection instructions provided also for more info and detail use the WAZA-AIR Owner's Manual and Device Connection Addendums below.\n- To start a fresh setup and pairing of your mobile device and WAZA-AIR headphones it's best if you first forget or unpair any BT WAZA-AIR AUDIO or MIDI connections on your mobile device Bluetooth system settings.\n**If you happened to have tried to pair other mobile devices or there are BT mobile devices nearby make sure to clear all paired instances of WAZA-AIR or set other mobile devices Bluetooth: OFF.**\n- Power Off your WAZA-AIR headphones **(2)**.\n- Power ON the WAZA-AIR headphones **(2)**,\nthen long press the Bluetooth button **(7)** for 3-4 seconds,\nthe BLUE LED **(5)** should blink rapidly showing ready for pairing mode.\n- Go to your ANDROID/iOS mobile device BT settings and first pair with **WAZA-AIR AUDIO** for the BT streaming audio connection.\n- Once successfully paired to **WAZA-AIR AUDIO**, open the BTS for WAZA-AIR Software Editor Mobile App and press the **PAIRING: BLUETOOTH MIDI DEVICE** selection **PAIRING BUTTON** and in the **BT MIDI DEVICE CONNECTION** screen choose the **WAZA-AIR MIDI Input / Output** connection from the **BLUETOOTH DEVICES list**,\na small **\"CONNECTING\" message or * asterisk** will appear, use the return/back arrow (Android) or screen tap (iOS) of the mobile device to return to the app **BLUETOOTH PAIRING/CONNECT screen**, connections should now be listed -\n**PAIRING: BLUETOOTH MIDI DEVICE CONNECT: WAZA-AIR MIDI(Bluetooth)**, now press the OK selection button and wait for sync.\n- This should get you connected with both the **WAZA-AIR AUDIO for BT streaming music** and **WAZA-AIR MIDI for app sync control** with the **BOSS TONE STUDIO for WAZA-AIR software editor app**.\n- For **2.4GhZ Wireless Guitar audio connection:** Pair your WL-T Transmitter with the WAZA-AIR HEADSET by mating and connecting the WL-T to the WAZA-AIR Pairing Jack **(9)**, **wait and allow for 10 seconds or LED blinks** **for proper pairing and CHANNEL selection**, 1 of 14 CHANNELS with the least amount of interference will be selected. **Once the LED on the WL-T has gone dim then it has chosen and paired, now separate the WL-T and connect to GUITAR OUTPUT jack for usage.**\n

På side 12 under FX1/FX2/FX3/FX4 TYPE beskrives det desuden, hvordan COMPRESSOR kan bruges som limiter til kun at undertrykke spidserne og dermed forhindre forvrængning.\n\nHer er det direkte link til guiden - https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/GT-1000_parameter_eng12_W.pdf\n\nJeg er dog klar over, at det ville være nyttigt at have en dedikeret limiter.
