"""
The Orchestrator coordinates the entire workflow and handles errors
Orchestration Responsibilities:
Memory management: Update translation memory and conversation context
Result formatting: Prepare user-friendly output with quality indicators
Error coordination: Handle failures and route to appropriate recovery strategies

Role: The "Project Manager" - coordinates final output and drives continuous improvement.

Output Coordination:
- Confidence Scoring: Provides reliability indicators for each translation
- Alternative Suggestions: When multiple valid translations exist
- Explanation Generation: Why certain translation choices were made
- Improvement Recommendations: How to get better results next time

Continuous Learning Engine:
- Feedback Integration: Learns from user corrections and preferences
- Performance Analytics: Tracks which agent combinations work best for different content
- Pattern Recognition: Identifies recurring translation challenges
- Strategy Optimization: Adjusts routing and processing strategies over time

Business Intelligence:
- Usage Analytics: Which languages/domains are most requested
- Quality Trends: Are translations getting better over time?
- Cost Optimization: Which service combinations provide best value
- Scalability Insights: When to upgrade services or add capacity
