# Multi-Agent Translation Architecture
This architecture is designed to translate text from one language to another.
The system is built a system with 5 specialized agents, as follows:

### 1. Router Agent
Analyzes incoming text and determines translation complexity, routing to appropriate specialists

### 2. Context Manager Agent
Maintains conversation history and translation memory for consistency

### 3. Translation Agent
Performs the actual translation with domain-specific expertise

### 4. QA Agent
Reviews translation quality and flags issues requiring human attention

### 5. Orchestrator Agent
Coordinates the workflow and handles error recovery


## Agent Communication Patterns
Shared State Pattern: All agents access the same TranslationState, enabling full context visibility
Sequential Handoffs: Router → Context Manager → Translation → QA → Orchestrator
Conditional Loops: QA can send work back to Translation for quality improvements
